She gave them an asssignment on calculating the distance between the points. In order to prevent copying, she gave each student a different set of questions. But she found it very difficult to correct all 100 assignments. She seeks your help. Can you please help her out?\n\n\nGiven the vertices of a triangle ABC, determine the sides of the triangle AB, BC and AC. Can you write a C program to calculate the sides?\n\n\nInput Format\n\nInput consists of 6 integers. The first 2 integers correspond to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of vertex A. The next 2 integers correspond to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of vertex B. The next 2 integers correspond to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of vertex C.\n\n\nOutput Format:\n\nRefer Sample Input and Output for exact formatting specifications.\n\n[All floating point values are displayed correct to 1 decimal place]", "TESTCASE_1": "5 10\n10 10\n8 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength of side AB is 5.0\nLength of side BC is 6.3\nLength of side AC is 6.7", "TESTCASE_2": "3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength of side AB is 1.4\nLength of side BC is 1.4\nLength of side AC is 2.8", "TESTCASE_3": "2 5\n2 3\n9 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength of side AB is 2.0\nLength of side BC is 9.2\nLength of side AC is 8.1", "TESTCASE_4": "2 5\n1 2\n8 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength of side AB is 3.2\nLength of side BC is 9.2\nLength of side AC is 6.7", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
