The area is given by: Heron's formula\n\n\nHeron was one of the great mathematicians of antiquity and came up with this formula sometime in the first century BC, although it may have been known earlier. He also extended it to the area of quadrilaterals and higher-order polygons\n\nInput:\nInput  should contain three sides a,b,c\nOutput:\nShould display the area of triangle in sq.units", "TESTCASE_1": "5 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nArea=14.6969", "TESTCASE_2": "10 5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nArea=16.2481", "TESTCASE_3": "10 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nArea=20.6625", "TESTCASE_4": "5 6 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nArea=14.9812", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
