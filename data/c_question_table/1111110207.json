Odd and even numbers are extracted from this variable n using pointers n1 and n2. The variable n is divided by 10 and the remainder is stored in variable r. The quotient obtained after this division is considered as variable n. Then variable r is then divided by 2 and if it returns 0 as remainder ,then the variable r is considered as even number and stored in pointer n2 .\n\nIf 0 is not obtained, then the variable r is considered as odd number and stored in pointer n1. \n\nThis process continuous until the variable n is decremented to 0", "TESTCASE_1": "123456\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n135 246", "TESTCASE_2": "1234\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13 24", "TESTCASE_3": "445522\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n55 4422", "TESTCASE_4": "112233\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1133 22", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
