The variable n is divided by 10 and the remainder is stored in variable r.The quotient obtained after this division is considered as variable n.Then variable r is then divided by 2 and if it returns 0 as remainder ,then the variable r is considered as even number and stored in pointer n2 .If 0 is not obtained, then the variable r is considered as odd number and stored in pointer n1. This process continuous until the variable n is decremented to 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "1234657676\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13577 24666", "TESTCASE_2": "1234\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13 24", "TESTCASE_3": "423534690857\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n353957 424608", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
