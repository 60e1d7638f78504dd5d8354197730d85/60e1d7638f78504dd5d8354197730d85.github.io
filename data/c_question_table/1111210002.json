For the second test case, Bob subtracts 1 from N. Now, Alice cannot make a move and loses the game.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nALICE\nBOB", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nALICE", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
