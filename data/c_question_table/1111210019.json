(Specially, his girlfriend Big Jhool!) But, in spite all his efforts, hardwork, dedication, Googling, watching youtube videos he couldnt garner any psychic abilities!   Explanation\nSince the binary number given has six consecutive 1s, little Jhool tells the man that hes going to have a bad time!\n\nHe knew everyone was making fun of him, so to stop all of that - he came up with a smart plan. Anyone who came to him to know about their future, he asked them to write a binary number for him - and then, he smartly told them if the future for that person had good in store, or bad.\n\nThe algorithm which Little Jhool follows is, as following:\n\nIf the binary number written by the person has six consecutive \n0or 1s his future is bad.Otherwise, he says that their future is good.\nInput format:\n\nSingle line contains a binary number.\n\n\nOutput format:\n\nYou need to print \"good luck!\" (Without quotes, and WITH exclamation mark!) if the Jhool is going to tell them that theyre going to have a good time. Else, print \"sorry sorry!\" if the person is going to be told that hell have a hard time!\n\nConstraints:\n\nThe binary number will be in string format, with the maximum length being \n100\n100 characters.", "TESTCASE_1": "1111110\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nsorry,sorry!", "TESTCASE_2": "100111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nGood luck!", "TESTCASE_3": "11111102111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nsorry,sorry!", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
