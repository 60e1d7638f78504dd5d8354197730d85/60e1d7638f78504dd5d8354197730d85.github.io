{"Q_ID": "1111210022", "S_NAME": "Input & Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Numbers in Triples", "Q_DESC": "You just need to count the number of ordered triples of different numbers (A1, A2, A3), where Ai could be any positive integer from 1 to Ni, inclusive (i = 1, 2, 3).\n\nNo, wait. I forgot to mention that numbers N1, N2, N3 could be up to 1018. Well, in any case it is still quite simple :)\n\nBy the way, because of this the answer could be quite large. Hence you should output it modulo 109 + 7. That is you need to find the remainder of the division of the number of required triples by 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N1, N2, N3.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of required triples modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= A <= 1000\n1 <= Ni <=1018\nExplanation\nExample case 1. We have the following triples composed of different numbers up to 3:\n(1, 2, 3)\n(1, 3, 2)\n(2, 1, 3)\n(2, 3, 1)\n(3, 1, 2)\n(3, 2, 1)\nExample case 2. Here the triples are:\n(1, 3, 2)\n(1, 4, 2)\n(2, 3, 1)\n(2, 4, 1)\nExample case 3. Here the only triple is (1, 2, 3).\nExample case 5. ... and Happy New Year! By the way here the answer is zero since the only choice for A1 and for is A2 is 1, so any such triple will have equal numbers.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n3 3 3\n2 4 2\n1 2 3\n25 12 2012\n1 1 2013\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n4\n1\n578880\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n1000 10 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n89820", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
