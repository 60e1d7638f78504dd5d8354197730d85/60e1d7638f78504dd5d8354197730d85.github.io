This time they have to travel without their guardians. Rahul got very interested in the arrangement of seats inside the train coach.\n\nThe entire coach could be viewed as an arrangement of consecutive blocks of size 8.\n\n\nBerth Number    Compartment\n\n 1 -  8               1  \n 9 - 16               2  \n17 - 24               3  \n... and so on\n\nEach of these size-8 blocks are further arranged as:\n\n\n 1LB,  2MB,  3UB,  4LB,  5MB,  6UB,  7SL,  8SU  \n 9LB, 10MB, ...\n ...   \n ...\n\nHere LB denotes lower berth, MB middle berth and UB upper berth.\n\nThe following berths are called Train-Partners:\n\n\n3UB   |  6UB  \n2MB   |  5MB  \n1LB   |  4LB  \n7SL   |  8SU  \n\nand the pattern is repeated for every set of 8 berths.\n\nRahul and Rashi are playing this game of finding the train partner of each berth. Can you write a program to do the same?Input:The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.\n\nEach of the next T lines contain a single integer N, the berth number whose neighbor is to be found out.Output\n\nThe output should contain exactly T lines each containing the berth of the neighbor of the corresponding seat.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.\n\nEach of the next T lines contain a single integer N, the berth number whose neighbor is to be found out.\nOutput\n\nThe output should contain exactly T lines each containing the berth of the neighbor of the corresponding seat.\"\n                                          \n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3 \n1\n5 \n3\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4LB2MB6UB\n\n", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5MB1LB", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8SU", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
