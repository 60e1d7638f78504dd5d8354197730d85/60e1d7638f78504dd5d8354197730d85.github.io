It consists of threerods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slideonto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. We have to obtain the same stack on the third rod. Write a program using recursive function.\n\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C\n Move disk 2 from peg A to peg B\n Move disk 1 from peg C to peg B\n Move disk 3 from peg A to peg C\n Move disk 1 from peg B to peg A\n Move disk 2 from peg B to peg C\n Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMove disk 1 from peg A to peg B\n Move disk 2 from peg A to peg C\n Move disk 1 from peg B to peg C", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
