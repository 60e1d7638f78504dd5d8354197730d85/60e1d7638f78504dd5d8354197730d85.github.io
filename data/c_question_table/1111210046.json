The program accepts X and Y. Depending on the value of X and Y we need to determine on which quadrant this point lies.If both x y are equal to zero it is in origin. \n\nBoth are negative it is in third quadrant. If both are positive it is in first quadrant. \n\nIf x is greater than 0 and y is less than 0 it is in second quadrant. If x is less than 0 and y is greater than 0 it is in fourth quadrant.\n\n1st = First quadrant\n2nd = Second quadrant\n3rd = Third quadrant\n4th = Fourth quadrant\n", "TESTCASE_1": "20 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\npoint(20,30)lies in the First quadrant", "TESTCASE_2": "-30 -60\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\npoint(-30,-60)lies in the Third quadrant", "TESTCASE_3": "300 -8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\npoint(300,-8)lies in the Fourth quadrant", "TESTCASE_4": "-180 180\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\npoint(-180,180)lies in the Second quadrant", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
