So please find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. Note that if she orders the same menu twice, then it is considered as two menus are ordered. (See Explanations for details)\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer p.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p.\nConstraints\n\n1  T  5\n1  p  100000 (105)\nThere exists combinations of menus whose total price is exactly p.\nSample Input\n\n4\n10\n256\n255\n4096\n\nSample Output\n\n2\n1\n8\n2\n\nExplanations\n\nIn the first sample, examples of the menus whose total price is 10 are the following:\n1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 10 (10 menus)\n1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2 = 10 (9 menus)\n2+2+2+2+2 = 10 (5 menus)\n2+4+4 = 10 (3 menus)\n2+8 = 10 (2 menus)\nHere the minimum number of menus is 2.\n\nIn the last sample, the optimal way is 2048+2048=4096 (2 menus).
