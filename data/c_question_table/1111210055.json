{"Q_ID": "1111210055", "S_NAME": "Input & Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Checking the Calendar", "Q_DESC": "You are given names of two days of the week.Please, determine whether it is possible that during some non-leap year the first day of some month was equal to the first day of the week you are given, while the first day of the next month was equal to the second day of the week you are given. Both months should belong to one year.\nIn this problem, we consider the Gregorian calendar to be used. The number of months in this calendar is equal to 12. The number of days in months during any non-leap year is: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31.\nNames of the days of the week are given with lowercase English letters: \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\", \"sunday\".\nInput\nThe input consists of two lines, each of them containing the name of exactly one day of the week. It's guaranteed that each string in the input is from the set \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\", \"sunday\".\nOutput\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if such situation is possible during some non-leap year. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n", "TESTCASE_1": "monday\ntuesday\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "sunday\nsunday\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "saturday\ntuesday\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
