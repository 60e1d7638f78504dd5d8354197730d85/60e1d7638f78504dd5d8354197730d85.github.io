{"Q_ID": "1111310001", "S_NAME": "Input & Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Tojo hates probabilities-CIOE001", "Q_DESC": "As a holiday gift, Tojo received a probability problem. The problem read as follows\n\nConsider an N by M grid. Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\n\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1<=i<=N, 1<= i<=M.\n\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems. He wants you to solve this task\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.Only line of each test case has two integer N and M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer. Answers within an absolute or relative error of 10-6 will be accepted.\n\nConstraints\n1 <=T <=1000\n1 <=N <=1000\n1 <= M <= 1000\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 2\n1 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
