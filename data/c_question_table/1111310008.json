{"Q_ID": "1111310008", "S_NAME": "Input  Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Square in numbers", "Q_DESC": "Leha is a bright mathematician. Today he is investigating whether an integer is divisible by some square number or not.\n\nHe has a positive integer X represented as a product of N integers a1, a2, .... aN. He has somehow figured out that there exists some integer P such that the number X is divisible by P2, but he is not able to find such P himself. Can you find it for him? If there are more than one possible values of P possible, you can print any one of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of intgers in presentation of X.\n\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, .... aN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer P deoting the answer for this test case. Note that P must be in range from 2 to 1018 inclusive. Its guaranteed that at least one answer exists. If there are more than one possible answers, print any.\n\nConstraints", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3\n21 11 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
