The description of T test cases follows. \n\nEach test case consist of single integer N, the trace of the matrix.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of Positive Invertible Integer Matrices such that their trace is equal to N and determinant is positive.\n\nRead here for additional info:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 ?
