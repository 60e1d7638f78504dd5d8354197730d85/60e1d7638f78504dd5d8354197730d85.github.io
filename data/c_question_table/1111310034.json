{"Q_ID": "1111310034", "S_NAME": "Input  Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Mark The Answer", "Q_DESC": "Our friend Monk has an exam that has quite weird rules. Each question has a difficulty level in the form of an Integer. Now, Monk can only solve the problems that have difficulty level less than X . Now the rules are-\n\n    Score of the student is equal to the maximum number of answers he/she has attempted without skipping a question.\n    Student is allowed to skip just one question that will not be counted in the continuity of the questions.\n\nNote- Assume the student knows the solution to the problem he/she attempts and always starts the paper from first question.\n\nGiven the number of Questions, N ,the maximum difficulty level of the problem Monk can solve , X\n,and the difficulty level of each question , Ai\n\ncan you help him determine his maximum score?\n\nInput Format\nFirst Line contains Integer N\n, the number of questions and the maximum difficulty X Monk can solve.\nNext line contains N integers, Ai\n\ndenoting the difficulty level of each question.\n\nOutput Format\nMaximum score Monk can achieve in the exam.\n\nConstraints\n\n    1N105\n\n1X109\n1Ai109\nExample:\nsample Input:7 6\n4 3 7 6 7 2 2\noutput:3\n Explanation\n\nIn this example, maximum difficulty = 6, Monk solves question 0 and 1, but skips the question 2 as A[2]6. Monk then solves the question 3 , but stops at 4 because A[4]6 and question 2 was already skipped. As 3 questions (0,1 and 3) were solved and 2 questions (2 and 4) have been skipped, therefore we print 3.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "7 6\n4 3 7 6 7 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "6 8\n6 3 7 16 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n", "TESTCASE_3": "4 69\n58 54 26 37\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
