{"Q_ID": "1111310036", "S_NAME": "Input  Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Monk and Rotation", "Q_DESC": "Monk loves to preform different operations on arrays, and so being the principal of Hackerearth School, he assigned a task to his new student Mishki. Mishki will be provided with an integer array A of size N and an integer K , where she needs to rotate the array in the right direction by K steps and then print the resultant array. As she is new to the school, please help her to complete the task.\n\nInput:\nThe first line will consists of one integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case:\n1) The first line consists of two integers N and K, N being the number of elements in the array and K denotes the number of steps of rotation.\n2) The next line consists of N space separated integers , denoting the elements of the array A\n\n.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the required array.\n\nConstraints:\n1T20\n\n1N105\n0K106\n0A[i]106\nsample Input:\n1\n5 2\n1 2 3 4 5\nSample output:\n4 5 1 2 3\nExplanation\n\nHere T\nis 1, which means one test case.\nN=5 denoting the number of elements in the array and K=2, denoting the number of steps of rotations.\nThe initial array is: 1,2,3,4,5\nIn first rotation, 5 will come in the first position and all other elements will move to one position ahead from their current position. Now, the resultant array will be 5,1,2,3,4\nIn second rotation, 4 will come in the first position and all other elements will move to one position ahead from their current position. Now, the resultant array will be 4,5,1,2,3", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n5\n2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n5\n1\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n1\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n2\n1\n13\n67\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n67\n13", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
