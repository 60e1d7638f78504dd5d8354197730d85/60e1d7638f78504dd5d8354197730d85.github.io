{"Q_ID": "1111310202", "S_NAME": "Input  Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Magic Sequence", "Q_DESC": "Johnny has invented a magic sequence. Each element of the sequence is defined by the same recursive definition - take some linear combination of previous elements (whose coefficients are fixed) and add to them the n-th powers of some integers. Formally: Xn = Xn-1*a1 + ... + Xn-i*ai + b1*d1n + ... + bj*djn, for some integer constants p,q,a1,...,ap,b1,..., bq,d1,..., dq. Of course, as the values can quickly grow, he computed them modulo a fixed value: 106. He wrote many consecutive values of the sequence, but then he lost most of his work. All he has now, is 10 consecutive values taken from somewhere in the sequence (he doesn't know at what n they begin), and the recursive rule. And he would like to recover the sequence, or at the very least, to be able to write the next 10 values taken from the sequence.", "TESTCASE_1": "1 1\n1\n1\n1\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30", "TESTCASE_2": "1 1\n1 \n1 \n2 \n1 3 7 15 31 63 127 255 511 1023\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2047 4095 8191 16383 32767 65535 131071 262143 524287 48575", "TESTCASE_3": "2 0\n1 1\n1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
