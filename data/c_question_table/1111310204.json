{"Q_ID": "1111310204", "S_NAME": "Input  Ouput", "Q_NAME": "Label Printer", "Q_DESC": "In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.\nThe colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a good control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, then one time color a...\nSometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a bad control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm.\nYou have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.\nThe string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from a to z.\nExamples:\ns=aaabbbbhaijjjm\nerror_printer(s) = 0/14\n\ns=aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm\nerror_printer(s) = 8/22\n", "TESTCASE_1": "aaabbbbhaijjjm\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0/14", "TESTCASE_2": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmxyz\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3/56", "TESTCASE_3": "kkkwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmxyz\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6/60", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
