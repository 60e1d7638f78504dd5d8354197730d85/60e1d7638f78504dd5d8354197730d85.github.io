During the training session Sereja orders exactly one pizza for each team that is present this day. He already knows that there will be ai teams on the i-th day.\nThere are two types of discounts in Sereja's favourite pizzeria. The first discount works if one buys two pizzas at one day, while the second is a coupon that allows to buy one pizza during two consecutive days (two pizzas in total).\nAs Sereja orders really a lot of pizza at this place, he is the golden client and can use the unlimited number of discounts and coupons of any type at any days.\nSereja wants to order exactly ai pizzas on the i-th day while using only discounts and coupons.
