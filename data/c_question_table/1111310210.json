The number on the top of the ball may be sameas the number on the bottom.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOn a single line print a single integer - the minimum number of moves to winthe game. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print Impossible(quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n1=n=10^5\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n3 100\n100 3\n5 4\nSample Output:\n\n1\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3 100\n100 3\n5 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "5 \n5 9\n5 9\n3 2\n1 4\n5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nImpossible", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
