Each ball has exactly two numbers (the number on the topand the number on the bottom). In one move Mr Naughty can rotate any ball sothat its bottom now becomes the top. Mr Nice knows the minimum number of suchmoves that can make at least half of the balls show same number on their top.So to win Mr Nice's game, Mr Naughty should figure out the minimum number ofmoves. Its not always possible to make such moves that satisfy the givencondition.In this case Mr Naughty should figure out that it is \"Impossible\" tomake such moves.Help Mr Naughty to win the game.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n - the number of balls. Thefollowing n lines contain the description of all balls, one ball per line.Each description has a pair of non-negative integers not exceeding 10^5 -numbers on top and bottom. The first number in a line is the number on top,the second one - on the bottom. The number on the top of the ball may be sameas the number on the bottom.The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOn a single line print a single integer - the minimum number of moves to winthe game. If it is impossible to make the set funny, print \"Impossible\"(quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints:\n\n\n1<=n<=10^5\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\n3 100\n100 3\n5 4\nSample Output:\n\n1\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3 100\n100 3\n5 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "5 \n5 9\n5 9\n3 2\n1 4\n5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nImpossible", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
