It is one of the oldest libraries in the state and has been a symbol of legacy. \n\nThe Library management wanted to rebuild the steel bookracks in the building and renumber them thereafter. \n\nEach of the  n racks should be assigned with a number from 1 to  n. It is very obvious that each rack should be assigned distinct numbers.  \n\nMark, a craftsman was assigned the task of renumbering the racks with his artistic carving. \n\nHe normally charges wages based on the number of carvings he does. While numbering the racks, he treats each carving of the digit in the numbers of the racks for wages. Hence he wanted to keep a note of how many such digits he is carvings. \n\nFor example, \nIf n = 13, the racks get numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, which totals to 17 carvings. \n  \nInput Format: \nThe first line contains integer  n, which corresponds to the number of bookracks in the library. \n  \nOutput Format: \nPrint the number of carvings that Mark does to number all the bookracks. \n  \nRefer sample input and output for formatting specifications. \n[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.] \n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "13\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
