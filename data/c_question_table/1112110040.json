This number has such a lot of properties, like:\n\n    Four is the smallest composite number;\n    It is also the smallest Smith number;\n    The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;\n    Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;\n    There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;\n    Lagranges four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;\n    Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;\n    In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;\n    And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!\n\nImpressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostyas list.\n\nThen, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.\nOutput\n\nOutput T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostyas list.\nConstraints\n\n    1 = T  =105\n    (Subtask 1): 0  Numbers from the list  9 - 33 points.\n    (Subtask 2): 0  Numbers from the list  109 - 67 points.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n447474\n228\n6664\n40\n81\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n1\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n12345\n345644\n6764344\n6789\n4465534\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n3\n3\n0\n3\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n0005\n123567\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
