This time he is targeting marriages. Archer, being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:\n\nA man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.\n\nA is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nYour task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Archers rule.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

(quotes are meant for clarity, please dont print them)\nConstraints\n\n    1 = T=100\n    1= |M|, |W| =25000 (|A| denotes the length of the string A.)\n    All names consist of lowercase English letters only.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\njohn johanna\nira ira\nkayla jayla\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "3\nnivi pavi\ntifu tifk\nvishu nisha\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "2\nirfu irfu\njesi mesi\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
