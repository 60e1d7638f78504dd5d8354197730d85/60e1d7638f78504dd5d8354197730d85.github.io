{"Q_ID": "1112110047", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "The best box", "Q_DESC": "Johnny needs to make a rectangular box for his physics class project. He has bought P cm of wire and S cm2 of special paper. He would like to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box.\n\nWhat is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.\n\nEach test case contains two integers P and S in a line (1<= P<= 40000, 1<= S<= 20000). You may assume that there always exists an optimal solution for the given input cases.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a real number that is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nFirst case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 3, 1 and 1.\nSecond case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 7/3, 4/3 and 4/3.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n20 14\n20 16\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3.00\n4.15", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n15 5\n25 7\n40 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0.27\n0.36\n0.93", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n40 20\n30 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2.64\n1.74", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
