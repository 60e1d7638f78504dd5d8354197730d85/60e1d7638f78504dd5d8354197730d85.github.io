He denotes it as sum(N). But today, as a true explorer, he defined his own new function: sum(D, N), which means the operation sum applied D times: the first time to N, and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation.\n\nFor example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21.\n\nTuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function. Will you help him with that?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing two integers D and N.\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, output one integer on a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n    1 < T<  16\n    1 <D, N< 4", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 4\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n21", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n1 7\n1 5\n2 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n28\n15\n231", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n2 6\n3 7\n4 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n231\n82621\n1186570", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
