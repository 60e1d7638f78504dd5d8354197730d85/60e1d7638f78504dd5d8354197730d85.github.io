{"Q_ID": "1112110212", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Grading system", "Q_DESC": " A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions.\nHardness must be greater than 50.\nCarbon content must be less than 0.7.\nTensile strength must be greater than 5600.\n\n\n\n\nThe grades are as follows:\n\nGrade is 10 if all three conditions are met.\nGrade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met.\nGrade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met.\nGrade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met.\nGarde is 6 if only one condition is met.\nGrade is 5 if none of three conditions are met.\n\n\n\nWrite a program, if the user gives values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and display the grade of the steel.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains three numbers hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel.\nOutput\n\nPrint Grade of the steel depending on Conditions.\nConstraints\n\n    1 = T = 1000\n    1= hardness, carbon content, tensile strength =10000\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n53 0.6 5602\n45 0 4500\n0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n6\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n90 0.1 6000\n4 8 40\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n5", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n40 0.4 6000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
