Each student in the university casts a vote. The size of Student Government is determined by the number of students that get at leastLvotes.\n\nEach person that receives at leastLvotes is given a post in the student government. A student should not vote for himself/herself as it leads to disqualification\n\nTaking Input as an arrayV, where the numberVidenotes the person who thei-th person voted for. Write a program to calculate the size of the student government.\n\nInput\nFor each test case, first line of input consists of two unique integers K and L.\nSecond line consists of the arrayV.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing an integer corresponding to the size of the student government.\n\nConstraints\n\n\t1<=K<=100\n        1<=L<=K\n\nInfirst test case, there are8students. A student must receive at least2votes to be part of the student government.Student 1,2 and 4 receive more than 2 votes.Hence size of government is 3 .Insecond test case, although both students receive the required amount of votes, they are both disqualified as they had voted for themselves.
