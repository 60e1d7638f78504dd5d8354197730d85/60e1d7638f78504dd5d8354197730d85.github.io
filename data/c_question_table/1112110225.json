He's stuck in a problem. Which states that \"\"Two fans, each with a single blade are rotating one above the other, about the same axis of rotation and both blades have the same length. Consider the blade as a rod. Both the fans are rotating indefinitely.\n\n\nFans can rotate in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction. There is a dot marked on the blade of both the fans and the dot is marked at the same distance from the center of rotation.\nYou're be given speeds of the fans.\n\nClockwise rotation - positive speed.\nAnticlockwise rotation - negative speed.\n\n\n\nHelp Chef to find the number of distinct points the dots will coincide on the circumference of rotation. \"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 2\n6 5\n1 -2\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n3\n", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n2 2\n6 6\n1 2\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0\n1\n", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 2\n2 6\n3 2\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n1\n", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
