{"Q_ID": "1112110226", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Good numbers", "Q_DESC": "\" A number is called a square free number if there does not exist a number greater than 1, whose square divides the number evenly/perfectly. For example, number 8 is not a square free number as number 4 (which is square of 2), divides 8. Similarly, number 4 is also not a square free number. However numbers 1, 3, 6 all are square free numbers.\n\nA number n is called a good number if following properties hold.\n\n    It is a square free number.\n    Let s denote the sum of all divisors of n (including non-trivial divisors like 1 and itself). Let c denote the number of prime numbers dividing s. Number c should be a prime number.\n\nYou will two numbers L, R, you have to find sum of divisors (including non-trivial) of all the good numbers in the range L to R, both inclusive.\n\nPlease note that 0 is not considered a prime number.\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 5\n6 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n30", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n1 6\n4 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n18\n36", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 4\n4 8\n5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n18\n18", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
