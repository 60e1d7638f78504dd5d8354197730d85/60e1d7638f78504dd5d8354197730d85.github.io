{"Q_ID": "1112110228", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Moving Coins", "Q_DESC": "There is a line with 1000 cells numbered from 1 to 1000 from left to right and N coins placed on it. Coin i is placed at cell Xi, and no two coins are placed at the same cell.\n\nBob would like to move the coins to the N leftmost cells of the line. To do this, he is allowed to take a coin from any cell T and move it to cell T-j, where j is an integer between 1 and K, inclusive. This action is possible only if:\n\n    cell T-j actually exists and doesn't contain a coin;\n    each of the cells T-j+1, ..., T-1 contains a coin.\n\n\nOne coin movement takes exactly one second. Find the smallest time in which Bob can achieve his goal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains one integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Then T test cases follow, and every test case is described by two lines: the first of them contains two integers N and K (1 <= N, K <= 1000), the second of them contains N integers X1, ..., XN in strictly increasing order (1 <= Xi <= 1000).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output one line containing the requested minimal time for Bob to put all the coins to the left side of the line.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first example Bob can move the coin from cell 7 consequently to cells 6, 5, 3 and 1, then move the coin from cell 4 to cell 3. In the second example there is nothing to move.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 2\n2 4 7\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 1\n2 5 9\n5 2\n2 5 4 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 9\n3 4 9\n2  2\n3 5 4 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
