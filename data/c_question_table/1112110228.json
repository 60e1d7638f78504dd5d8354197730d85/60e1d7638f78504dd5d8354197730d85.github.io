Coin i is placed at cell Xi, and no two coins are placed at the same cell.\n\nBob would like to move the coins to the N leftmost cells of the line. To do this, he is allowed to take a coin from any cell T and move it to cell T-j, where j is an integer between 1 and K, inclusive. This action is possible only if:\n\n    cell T-j actually exists and doesn't contain a coin;\n    each of the cells T-j+1, ..., T-1 contains a coin.\n\n\nOne coin movement takes exactly one second. Find the smallest time in which Bob can achieve his goal. \n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 2\n2 4 7\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 1\n2 5 9\n5 2\n2 5 4 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n-2", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 9\n3 4 9\n2  2\n3 5 4 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n-18", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
