Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made.\nIn order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements.\nCould you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the measurements. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the average value after removing K lowest and K greatest measurements.\nYour answer will be considered correct, in case it has absolute or relative error, not exceeding 10-6.\nConstraints\n 1 < T < 100\n 1 < N < 104\n 0 < 2K < N\n -106 < Ai < 106\nSubtasks\n Subtask #1 (50 points): K = 0\n Subtask #2 (50 points): no additional constraints", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n5 0\n2 9 -10 25 1\n3 1\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4.000000\n5.400000\n1.000000", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n4 1\n3 5 2 -3\n3 1\n-2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2.500000\n1.000000", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n5 1\n5 9 2 4 10\n6 2\n7 9 3 5 10 13 \n4 1\n8 2 9 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6.000000\n8.000000\n5.500000", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
