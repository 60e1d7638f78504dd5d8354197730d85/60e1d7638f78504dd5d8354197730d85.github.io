However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years.\n\nThe rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:\n\n Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.\n Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.\n Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.\n All other years are not leap years.\n\nWrite a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating\nwhether or not it is a leap year.", "TESTCASE_1": "2016\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "2001\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_3": "2017\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_4": "2012\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
