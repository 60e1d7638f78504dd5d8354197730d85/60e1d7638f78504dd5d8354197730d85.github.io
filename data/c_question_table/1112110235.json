{"Q_ID": "1112110235", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Good Numbers", "Q_DESC": "\"A number is called a square free number if there does not exist a number greater than 1, whose square divides the number evenly/perfectly. For example, number 8 is not a square free number as number 4 (which is square of 2), divides 8. Similarly, number 4 is also not a square free number. However numbers 1, 3, 6 all are square free numbers. \nA number n is called a good number if following properties hold. \n It is a square free number.\n Let s denote the sum of all divisors of n (including non-trivial divisors like 1 and itself). Let c denote the number of prime numbers dividing s. Number c should be a prime number.\nYou will two numbers L, R, you have to find sum of divisors (including non-trivial) of all the good numbers in the range L to R, both inclusive. \nPlease note that 0 is not considered a prime number.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of the each test case contains two space separated integers L, R denoting the range for which you have to find sum of divisors of good numbers.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line corresponding to answer of the test case.\nConstraints and Subtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points) \n 1 < T < 103\n 1<  L  R < 103\nSubtask #2 (70 points) \n 1 < T<  105\n 1  <L  R<  105\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 5\n6 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n30", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n11 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n74", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n16 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n38", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
