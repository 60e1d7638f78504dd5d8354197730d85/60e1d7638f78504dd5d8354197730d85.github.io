For example, if the user enters 5.5 then your program should indicate that a magnitude 5.5 earthquake is considered to be a moderate earthquake", "TESTCASE_1": "7.9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMajor", "TESTCASE_2": "2.5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nVery minor", "TESTCASE_3": "11.4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMeteoric", "TESTCASE_4": "4.4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLight", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
