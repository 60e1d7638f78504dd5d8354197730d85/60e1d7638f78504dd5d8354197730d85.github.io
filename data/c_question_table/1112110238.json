{"Q_ID": "1112110238", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Chemistry pH Value", "Q_DESC": "In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7 (25 C), being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively.\n\nMeasurements of pH are important in agronomy, medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineering, chemical engineering, nutrition, water treatment and water purification, and many other applications.\n\nThe pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement. Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or an indicator. identify Ph Level Name using the following condition. identify the pH value\n\nPh <7.0    acidic\nPh>=7.0     basic\nPh<0       neutral", "TESTCASE_1": "7.0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nbasic", "TESTCASE_2": "6.9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nacidic", "TESTCASE_3": "-12.2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nneutral", "TESTCASE_4": "5.5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nacidic", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
