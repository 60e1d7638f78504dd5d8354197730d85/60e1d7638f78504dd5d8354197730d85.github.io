{"Q_ID": "1112210010", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Laddu and his Garden", "Q_DESC": "One evening Laddu found some funny looking beens in his grandfathers garden shed, and decided to plant one of them. Next morning, to his surprise he found an enormous bean growing in his back yard. Undaunted by its size, he decided to count its leaves.\n\nYou must know that bean.s in Byteland grow in a very special way. At the lowest (1st) level, there is exactly one stem. At any level(including the 1st), a stem can end (forming exactly one leaf), or branch into exactly two stems which grow into the next level, following the same rules.\n\nLaddu believes he has managed to count the number of leaves at each of the levels of the bean.. However, you must know that before he began to count, Laddu ate one or two of the other beans he found in his grandfathers shed, and thats why he is not quite sure of his results. Please verify whether Laddus results may possibly be correct, at least in theory.\nInput\n\nThe input starts with a line containing integer t, the number of test cases (1= t = 20). The descriptions of exactly t test cases follow.\n\nEach test case starts with an integer k, representing the number of levels of the bean. (1= k=106). The next k non-negative space-separated integers (not greater than 106) represent the number of leaves of the bean. at successive levels, starting from level 1.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing exactly one of the words Yes or No, depending on whether a bean. having the stated leaf counts can grow in accordance with the Bytelandian rules.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n0 1 2\n3\n0 0 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes\nNo", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n11111 1111 11111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3\n1 2 5\n6\n0 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo\nNo", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
