{"Q_ID": "1112210016", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Q Query", "Q_DESC": "Chellan is good in Math, but liitle in Programming. He is asking you to solve following problem: Given an integer number N and two sets of integer A and B. Let set A contain all numbers from 1 to N and set B contain all numbers from N + 1 to 2N. Multiset C contains all sums a + b such that a belongs to A and belongs to B. Note that multiset may contain several elements with the same values. For example, if Not equals to three, then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 6} and C = {5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9}. Chellan has M queries about multiset C. Every query is defined by a single integer q. Chellan wants to know the number of times q is contained in C. For example, number 6 is contained two times, 1 is not contained in C at all. \nPlease, help Chellan to answer all the queries.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integers N and M. Each of the next M line contains one integer q, the query asked by Chellan.\nOutput\nOutput the answer for each query in separate lines as in example.\nConstraints\n1=N=10^9\n1=M=10^5\n1=q=3N", "TESTCASE_1": "3 \n5\n6\n2\n9\n7\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0\n1\n3\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "3 \n4\n6\n22\n22\n22\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3 \n5\n6\n2\n9\n7\n9999\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0\n1\n3\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
