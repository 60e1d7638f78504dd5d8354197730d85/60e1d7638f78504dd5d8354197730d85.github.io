A highly accomplished cinema manager named \"tin\" decided to solve this problem.\n\nWhen a customer wants to buy a ticket, the clerk at the ticket window asks the visitor if they need the armrests, and if so, which of them: left, right, or both. We know that out of the audience expected to show up, L of them only need the left armrest, R of them need just the right one, Z need none and B need both. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of people that can attend the show. In the cinema hall there are N rows with M seats each. There is only one armrest between two adjacent seats. Seats at the beginning and at the end of the row have two armrests\n\nInput\n\nInput begins with an integer T: the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line with 6 space-separated integers: N, M, Z, L, R, B.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing the answer for the task.\nConstraints \n\n    1  T  105\n\n    Subtask 1 : \n    1  N, M  3\n    0  Z, L, R, B  3\n\n    Subtask 2 : \n    1  N, M  30\n    0  Z, L, R  30\n    0  B  109\n\n    Subtask 3 : \n    1  N, M  106\n    0  Z, L, R  106\n    0  B  1016\n\n    Subtask 4 : \n    1  N, M  108\n    0  Z, L, R, B  1016\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2 2 3 2 1 1\n3 3 1 2 0 9\n3 4 5 5 1 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n8\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2 2 3 2 1 1\n3 3 1 2 0 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n8", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 3 3 2 3 1\n3 7 7 5 1 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n21", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
