{"Q_ID": "1112210039", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Please like me", "Q_DESC": " In a far away dystopian world, the measure of the quality of a persons life is the numbers of likes he gets for an article about their life. For a person to stay alive, he has to acquire at least L number of likes before D days pass.\n\nPeople in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a constant factor C.\n\nSo if one starts with S likes on Day-1, he would have D2 = S + C * S likes on Day-2, D3 = D2 + D2 * C on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would survive at the end of Day-D or not.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains a single positive integer T denoting the number of test cases. The following T lines represent a test case each. Each test case contains 4 space-separated integers L, D, S and C.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing ALIVE AND KICKING if the person would live, otherwise print, DEAD AND ROTTING.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 1000\n\n1 <= L <= 1000000000\n\n1 <= D <= 1000000000\n\n1 <= S <= 1000000000\n\n1 <= C <= 1000000000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 1 5 1\n10 2 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nALIVE AND KICKING\nDEAD AND ROTTING", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 2 1 1\n4 6 7 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nDEAD AND ROTTING\nALIVE AND KICKING", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n7 5 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nALIVE AND KICKING", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
