{"Q_ID": "1112210043", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "ABABAABA", "Q_DESC": "You are given a uniformly randomly generated string S, consisting of letters from the set {\"A\", \"B\"}. Your task is to find a string T that appears in S as a subsequence exactly twice.\n\nIn other words, you need to find such a string T, that there exist exactly two sets of indexes i1, i2, ..., i|T| and j1, j2, ..., j|T| such that there exists some k, where ik  jk and S{i1...i|T|} = S{j1...j|T|} = T.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.\n\nThe string S was generated randomly. For a generating string S, we first choose an integer N denoting a length of S. After that every symbol of the string S is chosen randomly from the set {\"A\", \"B\"} and the both symbols have equal probability to be chosen. Note that N is not choosen randomly.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a string that occurs exactly twice as a subsequence in S, or output -1 if there is no such string. If there are more than one possible subsequences occurring exactly two times, you can print any one of them.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nAAAA\nBAB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\nB", "TESTCASE_2": "3\nABAB\nBBB\nAAABB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nA\n-1\nB", "TESTCASE_3": "2\nAABBAA\nABABBA\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nB\n-1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
