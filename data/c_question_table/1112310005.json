{"Q_ID": "1112310005", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Chef and Bracket-Pairs", "Q_DESC": "Chef loves brackets. So much so, that rather than just use plain brackets like (), {}, or [], he has invented his own notation that allows him to use many more types of brackets.\n\nEach type of bracket is designated by an integer. A negative integer -x represents an opening bracket of type x; while a positive integer x represents a closing bracket of type x. Any sequence of such integers is then called a bracket-pair sequence.\n\nA balanced bracket-pair sequence can be defined recursively as follows:\nThe empty sequence is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.\n If S is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, then -x S x is a balanced bracket-pair sequence for any positive integer x.\n If S and T are balanced bracket-pair sequences, then S T is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.\nFor example, -1 -2 2 -3 -4 4 3 1 is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, but -1 -2 1 2 is not.\nChef has a bracket-pair sequence (which may or may not be balanced) consisting of N integers. There are 2N ways to form a subsequence of his sequence. He wants to know how many of these subsequences are balanced.\n\nHelp him to calculate this number, modulo 109+7.", "TESTCASE_1": "11\n-1 -2 9 2 -3 -4 3 4 8 8 1 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "011\n-1 -2 9 2 -3 -4 3 4 10 10 1 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
