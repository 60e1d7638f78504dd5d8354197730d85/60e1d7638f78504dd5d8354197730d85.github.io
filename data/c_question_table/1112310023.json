{"Q_ID": "1112310023", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Bajiraos Rescue Operation", "Q_DESC": "Baba has captured Avni to take revenge from Bajirao. Bajirao fights all of Babas men and reaches the place where Baba is waiting for Bajirao along with Avni, Avni tied by a rope.\n\nBaba has tied Avni with a magical rope, which will untie itself only when Bajirao answers the question Baba asks him.\n\nBaba asks him T questions. In every question, Baba gives two values to Bajirao, N and k. Bajirao has to calculate the value of\n\nFact(Fact(Fact(......Fact(N)....))) k times.\n\nwhere Fact(N) = 1 * 2 * 3 *..... * (N-1) * N.\n\nFor example if k=2, Bajirao has to calculate the value of Fact(Fact(N)) and if k=3, Bajirao has to calculate the value of Fact(Fact(Fact(N))).\n\nSince this number can be really huge, Baba asks Bajirao to give his answer modulo 107 ie. Bajirao has to give the remainder when Fact(Fact(Fact(......Fact(N)....))) k times is divided by 107.\n\nInput :\n\nFirst line consists of T, the number of questions Baba is going to ask Bajirao. After that, T lines follow, each line consists of 2 space separated integers, N followed by k.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor every question asked by Baba, print the correct answer on a new line.\n\nConstraints :\n\n1<=T<=100\n\n1<=N<=1000000\n\n2<=k<=100\n\nThere are 3 questions. For the first question, N=1 and k=4. So, We know that Fact(1)=1. Fact(Fact(Fact(Fact(1)))) =Fact(Fact(Fact(1))) =Fact(Fact(1)) =Fact(1) =1 1 % 107 = 1. So, answer is 1. For the second question, N=2 and k=5. So, We know that Fact(2)=2. Fact(Fact(Fact(Fact(Fact(2))))) Fact(Fact(Fact(Fact(2)))) =Fact(Fact(Fact(2))) =Fact(Fact(2)) =Fact(2) =2 2 % 107 = 1. So, answer is 2. For the third question, N=3 and k=2. So, Fact(Fact(3)) =Fact(6) =720. 720 % 107=78. So, answer is 78.", "TESTCASE_1": "1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "2 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n78", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
