You have to perform two types of operations :\n\n1) Increase the numbers between indices A and B by 1. This is represented by the command \"0 A B\"\n\n2) Answer how many numbers between indices A and B are divisible by 3. This is represented by the command \"1 A B\".\n\nInput :\n\nThe first line contains two integers, N and Q. Each of the next Q lines are either of the form \"0 A B\" or \"1 A B\" as mentioned above.\n\nOutput :\n\nOutput 1 line for each of the queries of the form \"1 A B\" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.\n\nSample Input :\n4 7\n1 0 3\n0 1 2\n0 1 3\n1 0 0\n0 0 3\n1 3 3\n1 0 3\n\nSample Output :\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\nConstraints :\n1 <= N <= 100000\n1 <= Q <= 100000\n0 <= A <= B <= N - 1", "TESTCASE_1": "4 7\n1 0 3\n0 1 2\n0 1 3\n1 0 0\n0 0 3\n1 3 3\n1 0 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n1\n0\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
