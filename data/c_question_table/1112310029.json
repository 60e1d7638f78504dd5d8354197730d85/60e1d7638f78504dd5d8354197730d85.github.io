{"Q_ID": "1112310029", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Chef and Rectangle Genome", "Q_DESC": "Chef has an empty matrix of NxM. He wants to construct rectangle genome. For this reason Chef should fill the matrix with letters G, ?, A, T.\n\nThe genome will be stable if it contains K different submatrices. Of course, Chef wants to make his genome as stable as possible, that is the difference between the number of different submatrices in genome and number K should be as small as possible.\n\nPlease, write a program for Chef that constructs as stable genome as possible. Note, that you must fill each cell of the matrix. Two submatrices is different if either one of their dimensions differs or for some pair of corresponding cells their content differs.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. Each of the next T lines contains the description of the testcase: three integers N, M, K.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase in the first N lines print NxM matrix. Each character of the matrix should be G, C, A or T.\n\nConstraints\n\n1<= T<=100\n1<=N <=15\n1<=M<=15\nTest Generation\n\nAll the tests contains manual (non-random) N and M values. Number K for each testcase was choosen uniformly from the range [1, N*N*M*M].\n\nScoring\n\nImagine that your matrix for some testcase contains W different submatrices. Your score for that testcase will be |W-K|/K. You score for all testcases is the sum of the scores for each testcase.\n\nThere are 10 cases in total, and only 2 of them are evaluated during the contest, while others are tested but scored 0, and will be evaluated after the contest", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 3 5\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nAAA\nAAA\nA", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n2 3 5\n1 1 1\n2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nAAA\nAAA\nA\nAAA\nAAA", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
