{"Q_ID": "1112310045", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "LAZY JEM", "Q_DESC": "Jem is famous for his laziness at school. He always leaves things to last minute. Now Jem has N problems in the assignment of Advanced topics in algorithm class to solved. The assignment is due tomorrow and as you may guess he hasnt touch any of the problems. Fortunately he got a plan as always.\n\nThe first step will be buying a pack of Red Bull and then to work as hard as he can. Here is how he is going to spend the remaining time:\n\nJem will not take a break until he finishes at least half of the remaining problems. Formally, if N is even then he will take he first break after finishing N / 2 problems. If N is odd then the break will be after he done (N + 1) / 2 problems. Each of his break will last for B minutes. Initially, he takes M minutes in solving a problem, after each break he will take twice more time in solving a problem, i.e. 2 * M minutes per problem after the first break.\n\nJem will start working soon and ask you to help him calculate how much time it will take until he finish the last problem!\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T represents the number of test cases in the input.\nEach line in the next T line contains three integers N, B and M represents a test case.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing an integer represent how much time Jem will need (in minutes).\nConstraints\n\n    1  T  100\n    1  N, B, M  108\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n9 1 2\n123456 123456 123456\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n45\n131351258112", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n125 214 251\n123654 4174524 4154\n26 62 77\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n112979\n4490681918\n5715", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n12 15 16\n48 45 49\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n493\n8065", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
