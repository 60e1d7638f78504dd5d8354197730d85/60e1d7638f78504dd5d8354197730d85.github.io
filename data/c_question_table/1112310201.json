{"Q_ID": "1112310201", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Chef and collection of stamps", "Q_DESC": "Chef has a collection of N postage stamps. Each stamp belongs to some type, which are enumerated as positive integers. More valuable stamps have a higher enumerated type. So, type 1 is the least valuable type of stamps, type 2 is a bit more valuable, and so on.\n\nChef often communicates with other philatelists via a stamp exchange website called P-bay. On any particular day, P-bay lists several offers, each of which is represented as an unordered pair {A, B}, allowing its users to exchange stamps of type A with an equal number of stamps of type B. Chef can use such an offer to put up any number of stamps of enumerated type A on the website and get the same number of stamps of type B in return, or vice-versa (of course, he must have enough stamps of the corresponding type). Assume that any number of stamps Chef wants are always available on the site's exchange market. Each offer is open during only one day: Chef can't use it after this day, but he can use it several times during this day. If there are some offers which are active during a given day, Chef can use them in any order.\n\nChef is interested in making his collection as valuable as possible. Help him to find maximum possible value of his collection after going through (accepting or declining) all the offers. Value of Chef's collection is equal to the sum of type enumerations of all stamps in the collection.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3 4\n1 3 5\n1 4 3\n1 1 3\n2 6 22\n3 5 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16\n", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n3 4\n1 2 5\n1 4 4\n1 1 3\n2 6 2\n3 4 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n14\n", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n3 4\n1 2 2\n1 2 4\n1 1 3\n1 6 2\n3 4 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15\n", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
