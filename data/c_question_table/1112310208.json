{"Q_ID": "1112310208", "S_NAME": "Data types", "Q_NAME": "Minimum Distance", "Q_DESC": "\"In Wolf town there are 2 big markets S and T. The distance between these markets is D. Chef Ciel would like to run 2 restaurants in Wolf town, where the first restaurant will be supplied by the market S and the second one will be supplied by the market T. The markets run delivery service without charge within some distance, DS and DT respectively. Near these markets there are many rival restaurants. So Ciel decides to build one of her restaurants exactly at the distance DS from the market S, and build the other restaurant exactly at the distance DT from the market T.\nChef Ciel would like to build her restaurants as close as possible to each other for convenient communication. Your task is to calculate the minimum distance that could be achieved between her restaurants.\nNote. Wolf town can be considered as an infinite 2D Cartesian plane. The markets and Ciel's restaurants should be considered as points on a plane. The distance between the two points A and B, whose coordinates are (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) respectively, is defined by Dist(A, B) = ((Ax  Bx)2 + (Ay  By)2)1/2.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers DS, DT and D.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum possible distance between Ciel's restaurants that could be achieved. The output must have an absolute or relative error at most 0.000001 (106). Please, note that your output should not have more than 1000 digits after the decimal point, otherwise you may (or may not) get wrong answer or runtime error (SIGXFSZ).\nNote also that the answer could be 0, which means that two Ciel's restaurants should be located at the same building.\nConstraints\n 1  T  2013\n 1  DS, DT, D  2013\n\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "15 15 50\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20\n", "TESTCASE_2": "15 15 18\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n", "TESTCASE_3": "43 88 200\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n69\n", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
