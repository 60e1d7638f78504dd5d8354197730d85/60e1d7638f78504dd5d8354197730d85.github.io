{"Q_ID": "1113110025", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "Sum of palindromic numbers", "Q_DESC": "A number is called palindromic if its decimal representation is a palindrome. You are given a range, described by a pair of integers L and R. Find the sum of all palindromic numbers lying in the range [L, R], inclusive of both the extrema.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a pair of space separated integers L and R denoting the range for which you are required to find the sum of the palindromic numbers.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the palindromic numbers in the given range.\n\nConstraints\n1<=T<=100\nSubtask 1 (34 points) : 1<=L<=R<=103\nSubtask 2 (66 points) : 1<=L<=R<=105\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The palindromic numbers between 1 and 10 are all numbers except the number 10.
