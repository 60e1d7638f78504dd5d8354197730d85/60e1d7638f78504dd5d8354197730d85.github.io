He denotes it as sum(N). But today, as a true explorer, he defined his own new function: sum(D, N), which means the operation sum applied D times: the first time to N, and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation.\nFor example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21.\nTuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function. Will you help him with that?", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 4\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n21", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n55", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7260", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
