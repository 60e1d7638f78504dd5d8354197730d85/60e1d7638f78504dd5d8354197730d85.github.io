One of the main task in the competition is to calculate the number of ways to create a number by adding some Chefonacci numbers. A number is called a Chefonacci number if it is an element of Chefonacci sequence defined as follows.\n\n\nf(0) = 1; \nf(1) = 2; \nFor i  1 : f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2)\n\nChef asked you to help him with this task. There will be Q question of form X, K : How many different ways are there to create X by adding K Chefonacci numbers. Note that the order of numbers in the addition does not matter, i.e. (f(i) + f(j) + f(k)) and (f(j) + f(i) + f(k)) will not be counted as distinct ways. Also note that you are allowed to use a Chefonacci number any number of times (zero or more).\n\nAs the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n12 1\n13 1\n13 2\n13 3\n13 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n1\n2\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n12 1\n14 1\n13 2\n11 0\n15 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0\n1\n0\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n12 1\n11 3\n15 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n3\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
