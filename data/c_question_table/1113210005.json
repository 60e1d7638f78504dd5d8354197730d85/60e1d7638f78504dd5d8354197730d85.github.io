{"Q_ID": "1113210005", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "N ingredients", "Q_DESC": "Rahul has received a package of N ingredients from Gothi Uncle andMary aunty as their Christmas gift. Rahul decides to make dishes with every possible combination of these N ingredients. (Note: A dish with 0 ingredients is also possible. Rahul uses it as an excuse for serving air to their airy customers). Every ingredient from the package has a taste score between 1 and 10.\n\nNow Rahul has customers on two planets, planet A and planet B. People from planet A like all the ingredients very much. And hence for every dish given to them, planet A will pay Rahul an amount, which, in Alterian dollars, equals the sum of the taste scores of all the ingredients present in the dish minus the sum of the taste scores of all the ingredients not present in the dish.\n\nPeople from planet B dont like the ingredients at all. So for every dish given to planet B, planet B will pay Rahul Alterian dollars equal to the sum of the taste scores of all the ingredients not present in the dish minus the sum of the taste scores of all the ingredients present in the dish.\n\nRahul can only make a single dish from a particular combination of ingredients. And they can send a dish either to planet A or planet B, but not both. You have to find out the maximum amount of money Rahul will make by distributing all the dishes made with these ingredients on planet A and planet B.\n\nReport the maximum amount modulo 107.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case begins with N, the number of ingredients\n\nThe next line for the test case contains N space-separated integers, which are the taste scores of the ingredients.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the value as asked in a separate line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 = T = 100\n1 = N = 1000\n1 = Taste scores of ingredients = 10\n1 =Sum of N over all Test Cases = 1000", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n2\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n5\n1 3 5 7 9\n3\n1 2 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n340\n72", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
