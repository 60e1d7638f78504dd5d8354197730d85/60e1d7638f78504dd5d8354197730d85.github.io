{"Q_ID": "1113210006", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "Samosa Bhai and his Courier Company", "Q_DESC": "Samosa Bhai got tired of the difficult tasks given by Chef along with meagre salary being paid to him. So he moves to Aloo uncles village and opens a courier company there. In the village, everyone knows Aloo uncle and Kachori Aunty, so everyone sends their gifts using Samosa Bhais courier company only.\n\nThere are N houses in a row in the village. On New Years Eve, each house sends a gift to all the other houses.\nThe distance between two houses situated at positions x and y in the row is |x - y|. Samosa Bhais courier company charges dk rupees for each delivery, where d is the distance between the 2 houses.\n\nEveryone chose Samosa Bhais company because of Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty. So he decides to give them the amount of money earned by him modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). You need to compute this amount.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of Ttest cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 2 integers ? N and k ? denoting the number of houses and the exponent k, respctively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ? , AN denoting the positions of the houses.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line with the amount given to Aloo uncle and Kachori aunty by Samosa Bhai.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 104\n2<= N <= 105\n0 <= k<= 100\n0<= Ai <= 100000000^6\nThe sum of N over all test cases will be at most 100000\n2 houses can be at the same position\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1. House 1 sends a gift to House 2 with cost (|2 - 7|)2 and house 2 sends a gift to house 1 with cost (|7-2|)2, for a total cost of 50\n\nExample case 3. The cost for gift from house with index 1 to house with index 2 is 22 = 4, from houses 1 to 3 is 1, from houses 2 to 3 is 1. Taking into account the gifts sent the other way (from 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 3 to 2), the total cost is 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n2 2\n7 2\n2 3\n7 2\n3 2\n1 3 2\n10 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n10 10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n50\n250\n12\n1650\n558199159", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n15 3\n1 5 7 9 10 13 15 17 19 11 2 3 4 8 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n199232", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
