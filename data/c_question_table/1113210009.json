He is stuck in a problem. Which states that Two fans, each with a single blade are rotating one above the other, about the same axis of rotation and both blades have the same length. Consider the blade as a rod. Both the fans are rotating indefinitely. \n\n\nFans can rotate in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction. There is a dot marked on the blade of both the fans and the dot is marked at the same distance from the center of rotation.\nYou are be given speeds of the fans. \n\n1. Clockwise rotation - positive speed.\n\n2. Anticlockwise rotation - negative speed.\n\n\nHelp Chef to find the number of distinct points the dots will coincide on the circumference of rotation. \n\nInput\nFirst line consists of T Test cases.\nEach of the next T lines consists of Two numbers S1 and S2 which describes the speed of rotation of both the fans respectively\n\nOutput\nPrint T lines with each containing the required answer.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100\n\nS1 =!
