{"Q_ID": "1113210026", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "Micro and Binary Strings", "Q_DESC": "Micros wife Mini gave him a bag having \nN\nN strings of length \nN\nN. All the strings are binary i.e. made up of 1s and 0s only. All the strings in the bag can be generated by a string \nS\nS by simply performing right rotations \nN\nN times. For example if \nS S is \"101 101\", then the strings in the bag will be \n\"110 110\", \" 011 011\", \"101 101\".\n\nNow Mini wants to know the number of ways of selecting one string from the bag with an odd decimal equivalent. Micro got very confused by all this, so he asked for your help.\n\nInput:\nThe first line consist of an integer \nT\nT denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case consists of an integer denoting \nN\nN.\nSecond line of each test case consists of a binary string denoting \nS\nS.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the answer for each test case in a new line.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=100\n1<=T<=100\n1<=N<105", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n2\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3\n101\n2\n01\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
