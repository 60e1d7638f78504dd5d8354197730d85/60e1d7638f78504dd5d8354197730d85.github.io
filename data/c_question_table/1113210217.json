Each cloud is either an ordinary cloud or a thundercloud.\nEsha starts out on cloud 0 with energy level E=100. She can use 1 unit of energy to make a jump of size k to cloud (i+k) % n, and she jumps until she gets back to cloud 0. If Esha lands on a thundercloud, her energy (E) decreases by 2 additional units. The game ends when Esha lands back on cloud 0.\n\nGiven the values of n, k, and the configuration of the clouds, can you determine the final value of E after the game ends?\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, n (the number of clouds) and k (the jump distance), respectively. \nThe second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of clouds c0, c1, c2...cn-1 Each cloud is described as follows:\n\n If ci=0 , then cloud  is an ordinary cloud.\n If ci=1, then cloud  is a thundercloud.\nConstraints:\n 2n25\n 1kn\n n%k=0\n ci{0,1}\nOutput Format\nPrint the final value of E on a new line.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "8 2\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n92", "TESTCASE_2": "2 1\n0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n96", "TESTCASE_3": "16 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n52", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
