The pirate king of the batch, Sanjay Prajapat, has the CD of his favorite WWE fight clip, featuring Stone Cold scaring the pants off Ronald Krump. He wants to upload the clip to a famous torrent website which features a pirate ship as its symbol. Since uploading the clip requires the CD be decoded, one must know about prime numbers. Sanjay doesnt know how to check whether a number is prime or not. So he took the help of his friend Bissu (the Java Collections God), who unwillingly gave some prime numbers to Sanjay. Thus Sanjay knows some prime numbers less than or equal to N. Since decoding requires bigger prime numbers, Sanjay wants to find how many prime numbers he can make using the sum of at least two consecutive prime numbers less than or equal to N. Help him find the count of such numbers.\nInput:\nT, the number of test cases\nEach of the next T lines contain a number N.\nOutput:\nFor each value of N, output the required number in a new line.\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 1000\n1 <= N <= 1000\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n9\n20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n7", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n40\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
