Let us number the people from 1 to N according to the order in which they arrive at the event. The dinner is being held in long straight corridor in which people sit in a way such that they wont leave any empty space in between two consecutive persons at any given time.\n\nWhen a person number i arrives at the corridor, he must go and stand to the immediate right of the person numbered A[i] (if A[i] = 0, then this person just stands at the leftmost end of the line).\n\nBut there is a problem, as there is no space between two consecutive persons at any given time, so for this person to sit, space must be created by moving either all the persons to left of the place to the left one step each, or all the persons to right of the place to the right one step each.\n\nNow, Sereja is wondering about what could be the minimum number of steps people will take so as to sit in the dinner party. Please find it fast, so that Sereja can peacefully entertain his guests.
