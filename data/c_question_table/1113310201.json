{"Q_ID": "1113310201", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "PLATFORMS", "Q_DESC": "In one one-dimensional world there are n platforms. Platform with index k (platforms are numbered from 1) is a segment with coordinates [(k-1)m,(k-1)m+l], and lm. Grasshopper Bob starts to jump along the platforms from point 0, with each jump he moves exactly d units right. Find out the coordinate of the point, where Bob will fall down. The grasshopper falls down, if he finds himself not on the platform, but if he finds himself on the edge of the platform, he doesn't fall down.\nInput\nThe first input line contains 4 integer numbers n, d, m, l (1n,d,m,l106,lm)  respectively: amount of platforms, length of the grasshopper Bob's jump, and numbers m and l needed to find coordinates of the k-th platform: [(k-1)m,(k-1)m+l].\nOutput\nOutput the coordinates of the point, where the grosshopper will fall down. Don't forget that if Bob finds himself on the platform edge, he doesn't fall down.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2 2 5 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "228385 744978 699604 157872\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2979912", "TESTCASE_3": "5 4 11 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
