But even in the world of their dreams, while they are snoring peacefully, the sense of impending doom is still upon them.\nA poor student is dreaming that he is sitting the mathematical analysis exam. And he is examined by the most formidable professor of all times, a three times Soviet Union Hero, a Noble Prize laureate in student expulsion, venerable Petr Palych.\nThe poor student couldn't answer a single question. Thus, instead of a large spacious office he is going to apply for a job to thorium mines. But wait a minute! Petr Palych decided to give the student the last chance!

They are the number of fingers on the Venusian girl's left and right hand correspondingly. The second line contains two integers not exceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Marsian boy's left and right hands correspondingly.\nOutput\nPrint YES or NO, that is, the answer to Petr Palych's question.\nNote\nThe boy and the girl don't really care who goes to the left.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1 1\n1 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "1 2\n11 6\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "4 5\n3 3\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
