{"Q_ID": "1113310215", "S_NAME": "Operators", "Q_NAME": "AssIGNrelationOP", "Q_DESC": "\"(Use assignment operator and relational operators)After Chef successfully built a modern (L, K)-window on the attic wall he decided to expand the notion of the (L, K)-window in some other areas. Now he considers a rectangular grid that contains only zeroes and ones and has size N x M. He considers the (L, K)-window here as any submatrix of size L x K that contains only ones. Formally he defines (L, K)-window as any (K+L)-tuple (R1, ..., RL, C1, ..., CK) such that 1 <= R1 < ... < RL <= N, 1 <= C1 < ... < CK <= M and A[Ri][Cj]=1 for all 1 <= i <= L, 1<= j <= K. Here A[r][c] is the c-th element of the r-th row of considered rectangular grid.\n\nWhy does Chef call some (K+L)-tuple of numbers by the window? Just mark all points (Ri,Cj) (1 <= i <= L, 1<= j <= K) on the plane and join by line segments all pairs of points that has equal abscises or ordinates and you will see that this picture is like a window.\n\nNow Chef considers some particular N x M grid and wants to calculate the total number of (L, K)-windows in this rectangular grid. Help him. Since this number can be very large calculate the result modulo 1000000080798150871. \"", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 2 2 1\n11\n01\n10\n3 3 2 2\n111\n101\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 2 2 1\n11\n01\n10\n3 2 2 2\n111\n101\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3 2 3 1\n11\n01\n10\n3 2 2 2\n111\n101\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
