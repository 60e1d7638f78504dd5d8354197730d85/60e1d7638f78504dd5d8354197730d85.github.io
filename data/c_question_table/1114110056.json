He does not know their exact count. But he knows that there are C cats and D dogs in the barn. Also, one day went to field and found that there were L legs of the animals touching the ground. Chef knows that cats love to ride on the dogs. So, they might ride on the dogs, and their legs wont touch the ground and Chef would miss counting their legs. Chefs dogs are strong enough to ride at max two cats on their back.\n\nIt was a cold foggy morning, when Chef did this counting. So he is now wondering whether he counted the legs properly or not. Specifically, he is wondering is there a some possibility of his counting being correct. Please help Chef in finding it.\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains three space separated integers C, D, L denoting number of the cats, number of the dogs and number of legs of animals counted by Chef, respectively.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a string \"\"yes\"\" or \"\"no\"\" (both without quotes) according to the situation.\nConstraints\n    1<=T<=105\n    0<=C, D, L<=109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points)\n\n    1<=T<=104\n    0<=C, D<=102\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points)\n\n    1<=T<=105\n    0<=C, D<=103", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 1 8\n1 1 4\n1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nyes\nyes\nno", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2 2 16\n4 3 28\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nyes\nyes\n", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n2 2 8\n3 3 24\n5 5 41\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nyes\nyes\nno", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
