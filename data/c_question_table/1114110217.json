{"Q_ID": "1114110217", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "REVERSE", "Q_DESC": "Dark was deeply studying in the afternoon and came across a concept called as REVERSE OF A NUMBER. He decided to design a program which can reverse any long numbers.\nAt the end of afternoon, he started to code and finally end up with no results, so decided to ask you all for the help, he wanted you to design a very efficient method to reverse a number and say it as a EVEN or ODD.\nConfused, Simply print EVEN(without quotes) if the reverse of the given number is even and print ODD(without quotes) if the reverse of the given number is odd.\nInput:\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases. Followed by T lines each contains a single number.\nOutput:\nFor every test case print the EVEN(without quotes) if reverse of GIVEN number is even else print ODD(without quotes).\nConstraints:\n1=T=10000\n1=N=10100\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n10\n22\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nODD\nEVEN", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n00\n11\n22\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nEVEN\nODD\nEVEN", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n500203\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nODD", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
