He loaded there a huge amount of n different natural numbers from 1 to n to obtain total control over her energy.\nBut his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn't perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.\n\nInput\nInput data contains the only number n (1n109).\n\nOutput\nOutput the only number  answer to the problem.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
