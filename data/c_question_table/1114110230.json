{"Q_ID": "1114110230", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Good Numbers", "Q_DESC": "A number is called a square free number if there does not exist a number greater than 1, whose square divides the number evenly/perfectly. For example, number 8 is not a square free number as number 4 (which is square of 2), divides 8. Similarly, number 4 is also not a square free number. However numbers 1, 3, 6 all are square free numbers. \nA number n is called a good number if following properties hold. \n It is a square free number.\n Let s denote the sum of all divisors of n (including non-trivial divisors like 1 and itself). Let c denote the number of prime numbers dividing s. Number c should be a prime number.\nYou will enter two numbers L, R, you have to find sum of divisors (including non-trivial) of all the good numbers in the range L to R, both inclusive. \nPlease note that 0 is not considered a prime number.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 5\n6 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n30", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5 1\n8 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n30", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n2 6\n8 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n18\n92\n92", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
