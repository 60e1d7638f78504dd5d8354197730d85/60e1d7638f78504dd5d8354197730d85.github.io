Of course, he will watch each movie exactly once. The priority of ith movie is Pi.\n\nA watching of a movie is called exciting if and only if one of the following two conditions holds:\n\nThis is the first watching.\nThe priority of this movie is strictly greater than the maximal priority of the movies watched so far.\nLet us call the number of exciting watchings the excitingness of the order.\n\nHelp him to find the number of different watching orders whose excitingness does not exceed K. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. The next line contains N space-separated integers P1, P2, ..., PN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the number of different watching orders having at most K excitingness modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  10\n1  K  N  200\n1  Pi  200\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 1\n3 1 2\n4 3\n1 2 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n24", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 1\n3 1 4\n4 3\n1 2 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n24", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n7 3\n3 1 4\n6 1\n1 2 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4290\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
