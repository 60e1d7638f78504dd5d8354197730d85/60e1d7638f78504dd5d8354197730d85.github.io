{"Q_ID": "1114110239", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Bachgold problem", "Q_DESC": "Bachgold problem is very easy to formulate. Given a positive integer n represent it as a sum ofmaximum possible number of prime numbers. One can prove that such representation exists for any integer greater than 1.\nRecall that integer k is called prime if it is greater than 1 and has exactly two positive integer divisors 1 and k.\nInput\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2n100000).\nOutput\nThe first line of the output contains a single integer k  maximum possible number of primes in representation.\nThe second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2 3", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2 2 2", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
