You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters 'z'   'y'   'x'   'b'   'a'   'z'. In other words, each character is replaced with the previous character of English alphabet and 'a' is replaced with 'z'.\nWhat is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once?\n\nInput\nThe only line of the input contains the string s (1<|s|<100000) consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput\nPrint the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by shifting letters of exactly one non-empty substring.\n\nNote\nString s is lexicographically smaller than some other string t of the same length if there exists some 1i|s|, such that s1=t1,s2=t2,...,si-1=ti-1, and si<ti.\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "codeforces\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nbncdenqbdr", "TESTCASE_2": "srmulc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nrqltkb", "TESTCASE_3": "chennai\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nbgdmmzh", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
