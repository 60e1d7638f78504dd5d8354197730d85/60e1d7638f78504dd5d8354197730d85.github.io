He gave Monish two numbers X and Y and asked him to find out the Nth number of the series which began with X numbers of Y?s and the following elements are equal to the sum of the last X numbers in the series. Help Monish find the Nth number of the series.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains a number T , number of test cases.\nThe next T lines each contain 3 integers X, Y and N separated by single space.\n\nOutput: \nFor each test case print the Nth number of the sequence.\n\nConstraints:\n1=T=10^6\n0  N = 50\n0  X  50\n0 = Y 3                              For X=3,Y=2 the series will be as follow:\n2, 2, 2, 6, 10, 18, 34", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3 2 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n34", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 4 7\n3 6 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n68\n6", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n1 2 3\n13 44 11\n1 2 3\n13 44 11\n1 2 3\n13 44 11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n44\n2\n44\n2\n44", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
