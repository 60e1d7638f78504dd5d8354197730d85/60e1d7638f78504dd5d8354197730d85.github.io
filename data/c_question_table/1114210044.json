He needs to diffuse all the bombs placed by Joker. Joker is extremely clever and cruel. He selected a region of 1000 X 1000 points, chose N center points of the form (X,Y) and placed bombs on every integral point that was on or inside the circular region of radius R around that chosen point. Then he went to every such point and activated those bombs that lied on or inside at least two such circular regions.\n\nIn order to make an efficient plan for the Bomb Disposal Squad, You need to help the Tomto determine the number of active bombs.\n\nINPUT:\nThe first line of the input contains the N. Next N lines contain 3 space separated integers X Y R as described above.\n\nOUTPUT:\nPrint the number of active bombs.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1 <= N <= 10\n1 <= X,Y,R <= 1000\nNOTE : The search area for the Tomis a square with diagonal points (1,1) and (1000,1000)", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 5 2\n3 4 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n552 323 495\n875 29 461\n185 599 497\n413 336 451\n202 440 460\n684 375 497\n587 393 495\n326 197 483\n358 164 486\n650 429 494\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n870523", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
