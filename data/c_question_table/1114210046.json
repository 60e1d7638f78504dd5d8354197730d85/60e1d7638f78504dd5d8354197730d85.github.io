Like if she wants chocolate, she will just keep on repeating ?chocolate again and again. \nI have decided to answer to her demands as Yes or No by not delaying a lot. Otherwise, there would be a lot of repercussions. So, randomly at certain intervals, I just answer with Yes or No using the following rule, I will just select two integers a and b, if the element at the position a is same as the element as position b in the non-ending chant by Trini, I will speak Yes, otherwise say No \nYour job is to find my side of the conversation given the name of the demand Trini has and the random integers I picked. \nInput:\nFirst line of the input contains a string S, the name of the item she is demanding.\nNext line contains an integer Q, the number of pairs of integers that used to say Yes or No to her. These pairs are given in order.\nNext Q line, each contains 2 integers, a and b. (1-based indexing) \nOutput:\nFor each query, print Yes or No as described above.\nConstraints:\n1=|S|=105\n1=Q=105\n1=a, b=1018\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "vgxgp\n3\n2 4\n2 5\n7 14\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes\nNo\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "srmuniv\n3\n3 5\n6 3\n4 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo\nNo\nNo", "TESTCASE_4": "srmuniv\n4\n2 4\n7 14\n2 4\n7 14\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
