He needs an implementation of complex number to use in his program. Develop an algorithm and write a C program to implement addition, subtraction and multiplication in complex numbers. Implement each operation as a function and call it in your main. The function call sequence is addition, subtraction and multiplication. For example when the complex numbers are 3+2i, 1+7i the output should be\n\n4+9i\n2-5i\n-11+23i\n\nInput Format\n\nReal part of complex number1\nImaginary part of complex number1\nReal part of complex number2\nImaginary part of complex number2\n\nOutput Format\n\nResultant complex number represented as\nreal part +/- imaginary part followed by an i", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2\n1\n7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4+9i\n2-5i\n-11+23i", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n6\n9\n11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n14+17i\n-4-5i\n-21+109i", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n8\n98\n14\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n103+22i\n-93-6i\n378+854i", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
