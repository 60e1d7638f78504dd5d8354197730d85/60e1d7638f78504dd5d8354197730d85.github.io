Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their fathers laptop.\n\nThey saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.\n\nThere are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 <= N, K <= 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.\n\n    CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 <= X <= N)\n    CLOSEALL\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click.\nExplanation:\nLet open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed.\nInitially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.\n\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2\nCLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2\nCLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3 6\nCLICK 1\nCLICK 2\nCLICK 3\nCLICK 2\nCLOSEALL\nCLICK 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3\n2\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "3 6\nCLICK 1\nCLICK 1\nCLICK 2\nCLICK 1\nCLOSEALL\nCLICK 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3 6\nCLICK 3\nCLICK 2\nCLICK 1\nCLICK 1\nCLOSEALL\nCLICK 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3\n2\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
