List the total no of possible paths which the rat can take to reach the cheese.\n\nInput\nA file whose first line contains the size of the square maze\nThe next n lines contain n binary values separated by space. 0 denotes an open cell while 1 denotes a blocked cell.\nYou have to find paths which contain only cells which are open, and finally print the total no of such unique paths. Retracing the 1 or more cells back and forth is not considered a new path. The set of all cells covered in a single path should be unique from other paths\n\nOutput\nThe output should be the total no of paths possible on the first line\n\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "7\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n0 0 1 0 0 \n1 0 1 1 0 \n0 0 0 0 1 \n1 0 1 0 0 \n1 0 1 1 0\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n1 0 0 1 \n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 \n1 0 1 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
