{"Q_ID": "1114210212", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Devu and a light discussion", "Q_DESC": "\"One day, Devu and Churu were involved in a light discussion about finding the diameter of an undirected unweighted connected graph. Diameter of a graph is the maximum value of pairwise shortest distances over all pairs of vertices of the graph. Churu proposed the following algorithm which takes a parameter start_vertex. \n\nAlgorithm (start_vertex):\n find out the set of vertices S having maximum value of \n  shortest distance from start_vertex.\n ans = 0;\n for each vertex v in S\n  temp = 0;\n  for each vertex u in graph G:\n   temp = max(temp, shortest distance between u and v).\n  ans = max(ans, temp);\n return ans;\nWhen Devu heard this algorithm, he exclaimed: \"\"What, this does not seem to be correct!\"\". Churu challenged him to give a counter example to disprove the algorithm. You have to help Devu come up with a graph as a counter example to the above algorithm, if one exists. \nFormally, You will be given an integer n denoting the number of nodes of the expected graph (counter example Devu is producing). The graph should be undirected, unweighted and connected. The actual diameter of the graph should not be equal to the one returned by the Churu's proposed algorithm. If for the given n, there does not exist any such graph which could act as counter example, print -1. \n\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n10\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n7 8\n8 1\n2 9\n8 10\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5\n6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n8\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 1\n2 7\n6 8\n1\n-1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
