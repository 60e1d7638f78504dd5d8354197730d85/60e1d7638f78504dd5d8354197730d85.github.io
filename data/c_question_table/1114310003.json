{"Q_ID": "1114310003", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "N different palindromes", "Q_DESC": "A palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.\n\nLets say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i  = j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.\n\nGiven an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n6\n7\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nabcabc\nabcabca\nab", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n6\n7\n2\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nabcabc\nabcabca\nab\nabc", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
