The princess has been made a prisoner by the neighboring kingdom Kadabra. Kadabra is a magical land and is full of challenges. Shiros army has to pass N levels before they can get to the princess. After each level, the army gets a few flags to carry along. The flags can either all be of kindom Abra OR all of kingdom Kadabra. The magic of Kadabra forces Shiros army to carry the flags irrespective of which kingdom they belong to. The princess doesnt know Shiro or anyone from his army. She will not escape with them unless she can trust them. She will trust them only if the number of Abras flags they are carrying is atleast as much as the number of Kadabras flags.\nThe army gets ai flags at the end of the ith level. Probability that flags received at the end of the ith level will be Abras flags is pi. Your task is to tell Shiro what is the probability that the princess will trust him once they reach her.\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test starts with a single line having an integer, N, the number of levels in Kadabra.\nNext line contains contains N integers with the ith integer being ai as described above.\nNext line contains contains N integers with the ith integer being pi as described above. Note that the probabilities given will be in percents.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a line containing the required probability. The answer will be accepted if the relative error is not more than 10-6.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5\n1 2 3 4 4\n0 100 100 0 50\n2\n5 5\n50 60\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0.5000000\n0.8000000\n", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5\n1 2 3 4 4\n0 100 100 0 50\n2\n5 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0.5000000\n0.0298000", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
