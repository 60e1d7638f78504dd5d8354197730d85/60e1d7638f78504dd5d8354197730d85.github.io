{"Q_ID": "1114310012", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Chef and Graph Queries", "Q_DESC": "Problem Statement\n\nChef has a undirected graph G. This graph consists of N vertices and M edges. Each vertex of the graph has an unique index from 1 to N, also each edge of the graph has an unique index from 1 to M.\n\nAlso Chef has Q pairs of integers: Li, Ri (1<=Li<=Ri<=M). For each pair Li, Ri, Chef wants to know: how many connected components will contain graph G if Chef erase all the edges from the graph, except the edges with indies X, where Li<= X<=Ri. Please, help Chef with these queries.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers N, M, Q. Each of the next M lines contains a pair of integers Vi, Ui - the current edge of graph G. Each of the next Q lines contains a pair of integers Li, Ri - the current query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query of each test case print the required number of connected components.\n\nConstraints\n\n1<=T<=1000.\n1<=N, M, Q <=200000.\n1<=Ui, Vi<=N.\n1<=Li ? Ri <=M.\nSum of all values of N for test cases is not greater than 200000. Sum of all values of M for test cases is not greater than 200000. Sum of all values of Q for test cases is not greater than 200000.\nGraph G can contain self-loops and multiple edges.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 5 4\n1 3\n1 2\n2 1\n3 2\n2 2\n2 3\n1 5\n5 5\n1 2\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n3\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
