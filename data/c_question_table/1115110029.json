From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only.\n\nChefs canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 105. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the ith millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isnt fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a timewith the same color. Painting over the same place completely replaces the color by the new one. Also, Chef has lots of bottles of paints of each color, so he will never run out of paint of any color.\n\nChef also doesnt want to ruin the edges of the canvas, so he doesnt want to paint any part beyond the painting. This means, for example, Chef cannot paint just the first millimeter of the canvas, or just the last two millimeters, etc.\n\nHelp Chef by telling him whether he can finish the painting or not with these restrictions.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
