{"Q_ID": "1115110211", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Mike and Matrices", "Q_DESC": "\"Mike is given a matrix A, N and M are numbers of rows and columns respectively. A1, 1 is the number in the top left corner. All the numbers in A are non-negative integers. He also has L pairs of integers (ik, jk). His task is to calculate Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL.\n\nUnfortunately, Mike forgot if Ai, j was a number in the i'th row and j'th column or vice versa, if Ai, j was a number in the j'th row and i'th column.\n\nSo, Mike decided to calculate both E1 = Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL and E2 = Aj1, i1 + Aj2, i2 + ... + AjL, iL. If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1. If it is impossible to calculate E2, then let's also assume, that it is equal to -1.\n\nYour task is to calculate max(E1, E2).\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.\n\nEach of next N lines contains M integers. The j'th integer in the (i + 1)'th line of the input denotes Ai, j.\n\nThe (N + 2)'th line contains an integer L, denoting the number of pairs of integers, that Mike has.\n\nEach of next L lines contains a pair of integers. The (N + 2 + k)-th line in the input contains a pair (ik, jk).\nOutput\n\nThe first line should contain an integer, denoting max(E1, E2).\"", "TESTCASE_1": "3 2\n1 2\n4 5\n7 0\n2\n1 2\n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9", "TESTCASE_2": "1 3\n1 2 3\n2\n1 3\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "1 3\n1 2 3\n2\n1 1\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
