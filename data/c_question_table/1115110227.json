He wants to perform the following operation on his array A.\n Select a pair of adjacent integers and remove the larger one of these two. This decreases the array size by 1. Cost of this operation will be equal to the smaller of them. \nFind out minimum sum of costs of operations needed to convert the array into a single element.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case starts with an integer N denoting the size of the array A. Next line of input contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes the value Ai.\n\"", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n2\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5\n1 2 3 4  5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4\n2 3 4  5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
