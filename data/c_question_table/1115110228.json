Ingoo, the largest CPU manufacturer in Byteland, would like to build a new chipset plant along the highway.\n\nIngoo currently has N warehouses in the kingdom. None of these warehouses are near the new highway. Chipsets manufactured from the new plant must be delivered to the warehouses. Thus, the further the distances from the new plant to the warehouses, the more the delivery cost Ingoo needs to bear.\n\nTherefore, the CEO of Ingoo would like to find a place on Highway 1 to build the new plant in such a way that the total distance from the plant to all the warehouses is minimized.\n\nYou are visiting Byteland on December vacation and have decided to help Ingoo to locate the new plant!\"", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n5\n3 -5 -7 \n1 3\n-2 4\n4 -7\n7 6\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n26.232349", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4\n2 -5 -4 \n1 2\n-2 3\n4 -7\n7 5\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n21.556151", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n3\n2 -5 -4 \n1 2\n-2 2\n3 -7\n4 5\n3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13.107019", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
