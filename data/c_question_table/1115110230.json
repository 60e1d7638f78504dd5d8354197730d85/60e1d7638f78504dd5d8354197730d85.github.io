{"Q_ID": "1115110230", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Digital Clock", "Q_DESC": "\"It's possible for all the digits displayed on a digital clock in the hours:minutes format to be identical. The time shown above (3:33) is an example of such a situation. Other examples are 2:2 and 1:11. Note that the digits of 33:33 are identical, but it is not a valid time on a usual digital clock.\n\nThe above example was for a usual 24-hour format digital clock. Let's consider a more general clock, where an hour lasts M minutes and a day lasts H hours (therefore, the clock can show any number of hours between 0 and H-1, inclusive, and any number of minutes between 0 and M-1, inclusive). Both the hours and the minutes are shown without leading zeroes in decimal notation and their separator (e.g., ':') doesn't matter.\n\nCan you tell how many minutes during a day will the digital clock have identical digits displayed on it?\"", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n24 60\n34 50\n10 11\n10 12\n11 11\n1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n19\n20\n10\n11\n10\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n30 60\n34 40\n11 11\n12 10\n10 11\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n19\n19\n10\n11\n10\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n30 60\n34 20\n11 8\n12 10\n11 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n19\n15\n8\n11\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
