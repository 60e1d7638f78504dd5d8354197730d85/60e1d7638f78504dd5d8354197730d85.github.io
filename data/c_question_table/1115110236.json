{"Q_ID": "1115110236", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Equalize", "Q_DESC": "Chef is creating a map for a certain real-time strategy video game. In this game, a map is a 2D rectangle of dimensions N  M tiles. Initially, the tile at row i and column j has a height of Hi,j. Heights are always integers.\nBefore creating the map, Chef first wants to make the heights of all the tiles equal. But he can only change height values using the equalize tool. The equalize tool is rectangular in shape, with dimensions K  L, and upon application, it replaces the height values of all the affected cells by their median. The equalize tool cannot be rotated. For example, in the following 5  9 grid of heights:\n9 8 8 8 7 7 7 8 7\n1 1 1 4 4 5 2 4 4\n2 3 1 2 1 2 1 1 9\n3 2 8 8 9 9 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8\nSuppose the dimensions of the equalize tool is 3  7, and we apply it in the middle 3  7 region. The median of the values in that region is 3, so after application, the grid becomes:\n9 8 8 8 7 7 7 8 7\n1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4\n2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 9\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8\nNote that K and L are odd integers, so that the median is always an integer.\nChef wants to make all height values equal by repeatedly applying the equalize tool. Furthermore, he also wants the final (common) height to be as large as possible. What is the maximum final (common) height that he can obtain?\nFurthermore, you have to answer Q queries, where each query denotes a different set of values for K and L\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3 7 3\n8 5 5 5 8 6 8\n8 9 5 5 5 9 8\n8 6 8 5 5 5 8\n3 3\n3 5\n3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n5\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "3 7 5\n8 5 9 4 2 3 4\n8 8 9 5 4 1 2\n5 8 6 4 2 1 1\n3 3\n3 6\n3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n5\n4\n5\n8", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
