At each step, he is going to take two mixtures that stand next to each other and mix them together, and put the resulting mixture in their place.\n\nWhen mixing two mixtures of colors a and b, the resulting mixture will have the color (a+b) mod 100.\n\nAlso, there will be some smoke in the process. The amount of smoke generated when mixing two mixtures of colors a and b is a*b.\n\nFind out what is the minimum amount of smoke that Harry can get when mixing all the ixtures together.\n\nInput\n\nThere will be a number of test cases in the input.\n\nThe first line of each test case will contain n, the number of mixtures, 1 <= n <= 100.\n\nThe second line will contain n integers between 0 and 99 - the initial colors of the mixtures.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum amount of smoke.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n18 20 45 76 89\n4 \n40 50 20 99\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6029\n4790", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n18 20\n3 \n40 50 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n360\n3800", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n18 19\n3\n40 60 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n342\n2400", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
