So at the end of the day, to make flower plants wither-resistant Chris uses special fertilizers.\n\nThere are N number of plants not sold on one particular day (say today), but Chriscan sell them the next day (say tomorrow) if he fertilizes them tonight. \nChris sells a flower plant for Rs. X. Cost of fertilizing a plant is Rs. Y. \nCurrently Chris has P Rupees with him.\n\nGiven the selling price X and fertilizing cost Y of N plants, your task is to find minimum amount A (A < P) that he should spend in fertilizing plants such that the total money he has after selling plants on the next day is maximized. Assume that all the fertilized plants are sold on the next day.\n\nInput Format:\nFirst line contains integer T - number of test cases.\nSecond line contains two space separated integers N and P.\nFollowing N lines each contain two space separated integers X and Y.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint the two space separated integers A and B in a new line for each test case.\n\nConstraints:\n1<= T<=10\n1<=N<=100\n1 <= X,Y <=1000 \n1 <=P <= 10000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 50\n80 40\n60 20\n5 100\n100 40\n50 40\n40 50\n60 20\n100 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20 90\n90 210", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n4 452\n83 24\n87 3\n75 12\n15 56\n1 6905\n95 59\n1 7958\n78 72\n2 8093\n91 38\n49 9\n4 1170\n82 75\n76 6\n1 26\n61 62\n3 2950\n57 70\n19 19\n31 5\n2 1892\n2 71\n79 57\n2 7485\n62 41\n9 20\n4 3587\n60 48\n26 83\n28 90\n85 54\n1 3044\n78 670\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n39 658\n59 6941\n72 7964\n47 8186\n81 1247\n5 2976\n57 1914\n41 7506\n102 3630\n0 3044", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
