What is the probability that he has a sum of K.\n\nA N faced die has all numbers from 1 to N written on it and each has equal probability of arriving when dice is thrown.\n\nInput \nFirst line T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of M, N and K in one line.\n\nOutput \nFor each testcase, print required probability in scientific notation as defined follows: \nOutput should be of the form x y where x is a floating point integer less than 10 and greater than or equal to 1and y is a integer. This notation is equivalent to x * 10-y. x should be rounded and output till 3 decimal digits. \nHowever, if probability is 0, output 0.000 0.\n\nExamples: If output is supposed to be 0.0034567, output should be 3.457 3. \nIf output is supposed to be 0.3034567, output should be 3.034 1.\n\nConstraints \n1=T =10 \n1=N, M=50 \n1=K=10000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1 5 2\n2 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2.000 1\n1.111 1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n5 6 23\n7 2 13\n2 9 11\n5 8 27\n3 10 21\n4 6 7\n2 1 1\n2 7 4\n8 3 6\n10 4 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3.922 2\n5.469 2\n9.877 2\n5.341 2\n5.500 2\n1.543 2\n0.000 0\n6.122 2\n0.000 0\n0.000 0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
