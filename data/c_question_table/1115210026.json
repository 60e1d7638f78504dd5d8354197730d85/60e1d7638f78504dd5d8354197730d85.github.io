He gave him an array of integers and asked him to tell him if he can arrange elements in the array such that the array forms a special sequence.\nA special sequence is a sequence in which every two consecutive elements have same difference.\nSince Khatu is good at solving problems he solved it within 1 minute. Now its time for you to solve the problem.\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains two lines. First line contains value of N, size of Array. Next line contains N elements separated by space.\nOutput:\nFor each test case print YES if it is possible to arrange elements of array such that array form a special sequence else print NO.\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=5 \n3<=N<=105\n0<=Ai<=109", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n4\n7 7 9 2\n3\n4 2 6\n6\n7 7 5 3 8 8\n6\n15 20 5 30 25 10\n7\n3 3 4 3 3 5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n12 8 4 0\n3\n10 15 50\n4\n20 40 4 11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
