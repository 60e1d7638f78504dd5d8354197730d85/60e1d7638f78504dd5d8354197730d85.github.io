So his teacher came up with a simple problem. He now has an integer array A. For each index i, he wants to find the product of the largest, second largest and the third largest integer in the range [1,i].\nNote: Two numbers can be the same value-wise but they should be distinct index-wise.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array A.\nThe next line contains N space separated integers, each denoting the ith integer of the array A.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the answer for each index in each line. If there is no second largest or third largest number in the array Aupto that index, then print -1, without the quotes.\n\nConstraints:\n1 = N = 100000\n0 = A[i] = 1000000", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n-1\n6\n24\n60", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n2 8 5 1 10 5 9 9 3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n-1\n80\n80\n400\n400\n720\n810\n810\n810", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
