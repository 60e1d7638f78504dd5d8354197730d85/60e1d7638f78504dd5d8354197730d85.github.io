{"Q_ID": "1115210030", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Shil and Round Numbers- CARA014", "Q_DESC": "Shil likes Round numbers very much . A number is called Round number if its non-negative and its first and last digits are same. For example 0 , 3 , 343 and 50005 are round numbers whereas 1000 is not a round number. \nShil has an array A1 , A2 .. AN . He wants to answer Q queries of following two type :\n1 l r : Find total number of round numbers in range [l, r]\n2 i K : Update ith element of array A to K i.e perform the operation Ai = K. \nSince you are the friend of Shil , he asks for your help .\nINPUT:\nFirst line consists of two integers N and Q. Next line consists of N integers A1 , A2 .. AN. Next line consists of Qqueries. Each query consists of three integers as mentioned in the problem.\nFirst line consists of two integers N and Q. Next line consists of N integers A1 , A2 .. AN. Next line consists of Qqueries. Each query consists of three integers as mentioned in the problem.\nOUTPUT: \nFor each query of type 2 , output total number of round numbers in range [l,r].\nFor each query of type 2 , output total number of round numbers in range [l,r].\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1 =N , Q =2*105\n-1018=Ai=1018 \n1=l,r=N\n-1018=K=1018\n1=N , Q=2*105\n-1018=Ai=1018 \n1=l,r =N\n-1018 ? K ? 1018   Explanation\nOut of all the initial numbers given in array A :- 1,2,33,111 are round numbers .\nFor 1st query , there are two round numbers - A[1] and A[2].\nFor 2st query , there are 4 round numbers - A[1] , A[2] , A[3] , A[5].\nIn 3rd query , we are updating 1st position with 6 , which is a round number.\nIn 4th query , we are updating 2nd position with 1000 , which isnt a round number. \nFor 5th query , there are 3 round numbers - A[1] , A[3] and A[5].", "TESTCASE_1": "10 10\n999999999999980689 -999999999999985424 999999999999997259 -999999999999980547 999999999999980429 999999999999985309 999999999999988309 -999999999999978240 999999999999973229 -999999999999986703 \n2 9 999999999999974279\n2 3 999999999999975369\n2 3 999999999999991679\n2 5 999999999999968959\n1 1 7\n1 5 9\n2 10 999999999999972219\n1 1 5\n2 4 999999999999993719\n2 5 999999999999995119\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n4\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "5 5 \n1 2 33 456 111\n1 1 2\n1 1 5\n2 1 6\n2 2 1000\n1 1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n4\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
