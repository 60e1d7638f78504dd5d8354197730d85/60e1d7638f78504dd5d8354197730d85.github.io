{"Q_ID": "1115210034", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Game Of Strengths -CARA026", "Q_DESC": "Andrew is very fond of Maths.He has N boxes with him,in each box there is some value which represents theStrength of the Box.The ith box has strength A[i]. He wants to calculate the Overall Power of the all N Boxes.\nOverall Power here means Sum of Absolute Difference of the strengths of the boxes(between each pair of boxes) multiplied by the Maximum strength among N boxes. Since the Overall Power could be a very large number,output the number modulus 10^9+7(1000000007).\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T test cases. Each test case has 2 lines. First line contains the number of boxes N. It is followed by a line containing N elements where ith element is the strength of Andrews ith box.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single number, which is the Overall Power for that testcase.\nConstraints\n1<=T<= 10\n2<=N<=10^5\n0<=A[i]<=10^9", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n1 2\n5\n4 5 3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n100", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n2\n1  3\n2\n2 4\n3\n1 2 3 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n8\n12", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
