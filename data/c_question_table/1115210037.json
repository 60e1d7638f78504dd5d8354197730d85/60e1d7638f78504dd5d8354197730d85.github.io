More precisely: there are N cities with integer coordinates. His plan is to travel between each pair of the cities.\nThe distance between city A with coordinates (x1, y1) and city B with coordinates (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.\nNow he is interested in the total distance between all the pairs of the cities.\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer N.\nThe following N lines contain two separated integers (xi, yi) each - coordinates of the corresponding city.\nOutput\nOutput one integer - the answer to the question. \nAs this number can be very big - output it modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints\n1 <= N <= 200 000\n|xi|, |yi| <= 109\n", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n-1 5\n1 6\n3 5\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n22", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n-2 -2\n1 0\n2 3\n3 5\n-4 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n70", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
