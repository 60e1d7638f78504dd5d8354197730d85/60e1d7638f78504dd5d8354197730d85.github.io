{"Q_ID": "1115210050", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "MazeProblem-CARAN024", "Q_DESC": "You are provided a matrix of size N*N with source position at (0,0) and destination at (N-1,N-1) in a 2D array. Some of the positions in the array are marked as 0 which are blocked cells, rest being marked 1. A path is a connected sequence of elements from (0,0) to (N-1,N-1) which consists of 1. A sequence of 1s in the 2D array is connected if every 1 in the sequence is adjacent (the above or left neighbour) to the next 1 in the sequence.\n\n For example, in the following matrix,\n\n1 1 0\n\n 0 1 1\n\n1 0 1\n\nthe 1s marked in blue is a connected path from (0,0) to (2,2) Note that cells at (0,0) and (N-1,N-1) are always 1. You can either make movement towards right or down, i.e., from position (x,y), you can go to either the position (x,y+1) or (x+1,y).\n\n Input\n\nFirst line consists of the size of the input array N (<=50), following that would be the state of NxN maze which would consist of 0s and 1s.\n\nOutput\n\nYou have to print \"POSSIBLE\" if there exists a path between the source and the destination otherwise print \"NOT POSSIBLE\".", "TESTCASE_1": "1 1 1\n1 0 0\n1 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nPOSSIBLE", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNOT POSSIBLE", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
