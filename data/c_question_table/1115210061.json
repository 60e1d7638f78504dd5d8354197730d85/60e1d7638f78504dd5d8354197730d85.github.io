{"Q_ID": "1115210061", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Palindromic substrings", "Q_DESC": "Chef likes strings a lot but he likes palindromic strings more. Today, Chef has two strings A and B, each consisting of lower case alphabets.\n\nChef is eager to know whether it is possible to choose some non empty strings s1 and s2 where s1 is a substring of A, s2 is a substring of B such that s1 + s2 is a palindromic string. Here + denotes the concatenation between the strings.\n\nNote:\n\nA string is a palindromic string if it can be read same both forward as well as backward. To know more about palindromes click here.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case:\nFirst line contains the string A\nSecond line contains the string B.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, Print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if it possible to choose such strings s1 & s2. Print \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1000\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1: 1 <= |A|, |B| <= 10 : ( 40 pts )\nSubtask 2: 1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1000 : ( 60 pts )", "TESTCASE_1": "1\nabc\nabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "1\na\nb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nabba\nbaab\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
