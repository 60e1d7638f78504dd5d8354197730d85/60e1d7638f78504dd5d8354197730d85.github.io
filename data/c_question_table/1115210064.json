Each question has a difficulty level in the form of an Integer. Now, Monk can only solve the problems that have difficulty level less than X . Now the rules are-\n\n    Score of the student is equal to the maximum number of answers he/she has attempted without skipping a question.\n    Student is allowed to skip just one question that will not be counted in the continuity of the questions.\n\nNote- Assume the student knows the solution to the problem he/she attempts and always starts the paper from first question.\n\nGiven the number of Questions, N ,the maximum difficulty level of the problem Monk can solve , X\n,and the difficulty level of each question , Ai\n\ncan you help him determine his maximum score?\n\nInput Format\nFirst Line contains Integer N\n, the number of questions and the maximum difficulty X Monk can solve.\nNext line contains N integers, Ai\n\ndenoting the difficulty level of each question.\n\nOutput Format\nMaximum score Monk can achieve in the exam.\n\nConstraints\n\n    1=N=105\n\n1=X=109\n1=Ai=109", "TESTCASE_1": "7 6\n4 3 7 6 7 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "10 15\n2 3 54 29 4 4 2 5 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "5 10\n11 12 9 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
