{"Q_ID": "1115310006", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Sherlock and the Grid-CARE026", "Q_DESC": "Sherlock is stuck. There is a N X N grid in which some cells are empty (denoted by .), while some cells have rocks in them (denoted by #). Sherlock is on the South of the grid. He has to watch what is happening on the East of the grid. He can place a mirror at 45 degrees on an empty cell in the grid, so that hell see what is happening on East side by reflection from the mirror.\n\nBut, if theres a rock in his line of sight, he wont be able to see whats happening on East side. For example, following image shows all possible cells in which he can place the mirror. \n\nYou have to tell Sherlock in how many possible cells he can place the mirror and see whats happening on East side.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line, T, the number of testcases. Each testcase will consist of N in one line. Next N line each contain N characters.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print the number of possible options where mirror can be placed to see on the East side.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n\n1 <= N <= 1000\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1. All places where rock are not there are valid positions.\n\nExample case 2. No valid positions.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n#..\n#..\n#..\n3\n#.#\n#.#\n#.#\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
