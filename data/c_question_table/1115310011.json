{"Q_ID": "1115310011", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "ABABAABA", "Q_DESC": "You are given a uniformly randomly generated string S, consisting of letters from the set {A, B}. Your task is to find a string T that appears in S as a subsequence exactly twice.\n \nIn other words, you need to find such a string T, that there exist exactly two sets of indexes i1, i2, ..., i|T| and j1, j2, ..., j|T| such that there exists some k, where ik ? jk and S{i1...i|T|} = S{j1...j|T|} = T.\n \nInput\n \nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n \nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.\n \nThe string S was generated randomly. For a generating string S, we first choose an integer N denoting a length of S. After that every symbol of the string S is chosen randomly from the set {A, B} and the both symbols have equal probability to be chosen. Note that N is not choosen randomly.\n \nOutput\n \nFor each test case, output a string that occurs exactly twice as a subsequence in S, or output -1 if there is no such string. If there are more than one possible subsequences occurring exactly two times, you can print any one of them.\n \nConstraints\n \n1 = T = 10\nSubtasks\n \nSubtask #1 (10 points): 2 ?
