To keep them busy, Chef has given them an array A of size N. He has asked them to plant trees at the points with Cartesian coordinates (A[ i ], A[ j ]), such that i < j.\n \nThere are a lot of giraffes nearby. To save the trees from the giraffes, they decide to build a fence around the trees. Moreover, they want to use the minimum length of fencing for this task. Find the value equal to twice the area covered by the fence using the minimum length of fencing.\n \nInput\n \nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases to follow.\n \nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, the size of the array.\n \nThe second line of the test case contains N space-separated integers.\n \nOutput\n \nFor each test case, output the value equal to two times the area, rounded to the nearest integer, surrounded by the fence when using the minimum length of net to surround all the trees.\n \nConstraints\n \n1 <= T <= 40000\n2 <= N <= 105\n1 <= Value of the array elements <= 108\n1 <= Sum of N over all cases <= 2*105", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n2 4 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n13", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
