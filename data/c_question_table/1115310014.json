{"Q_ID": "1115310014", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Little Elephant and Mouses", "Q_DESC": "It is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.\n\nThe Little Elephant is on a board A of n rows and m columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates (0; 0) and he wants to go to cell with coordinates (n-1; m-1). From cell (x; y) Little Elephant can go either to (x+1; y) or (x; y+1).\n\nEach cell of the board contains either 1 or 0. If A[i][j] = 1, then there is a single mouse in cell (i; j). Mouse at cell (i; j) scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell (x; y) (which belongs to that path) and |i-x| + |j-y| = 1.\n\nLittle Elephant wants to find some correct path from (0; 0) to (n-1; m-1) such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1.\n\nOutput\n\nIn T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 = T = 50\n\n2 = n, m = 100", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 9\n001000001\n111111010\n100100100\n7 9\n010101110\n110110111\n010011111\n100100000\n000010100\n011011000\n000100101\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9\n10", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
