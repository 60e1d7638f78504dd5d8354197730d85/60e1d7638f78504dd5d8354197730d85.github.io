Invalid sets are \n\n-{1,1,1,2} because 2 can be made by {1,1} and {2}and also 3 by {1,1,1} and {1,2} \n\n-{1,2,4} because all from 1 to 5 can be uniquely made but the sum is not 5. \n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T(1=T=1000) the number of test cases. Each test case contains a integer N (=10^9) in one line.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the solution of each test case on a line", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n10\n1000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n13", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n10\n100\n1000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n13", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
