Rahul got very interested in the arrangement of seats inside the train coach.\n\nThe entire coach could be viewed as an arrangement of consecutive blocks of size 8.\n\n\nBerth Number    Compartment\n\n 1 -  8               1  \n 9 - 16               2  \n17 - 24               3  \n... and so on\nEach of these size-8 blocks are further arranged as:\n\n\n 1LB,  2MB,  3UB,  4LB,  5MB,  6UB,  7SL,  8SU  \n 9LB, 10MB, ...\n ...   \n ...\nHere LB denotes lower berth, MB middle berth and UB upper berth.\nThe following berths are called Train-Partners:\n\n\n3UB   |  6UB  \n2MB   |  5MB  \n1LB   |  4LB  \n7SL   |  8SU  \nand the pattern is repeated for every set of 8 berths.\n\nRahul and Rashi are playing this game of finding the train partner of each berth. Can you write a program to do the same?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to follow.\n\nEach of the next T lines contain a single integer N, the berth number whose neighbor is to be found out.\n\nOutput\n\nThe output should contain exactly T lines each containing the berth of the neighbor of the corresponding seat.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1\n5\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4LB\n2MB\n6UB", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n4\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1LB\n2MB", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n5\n6\n7\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2MB\n3UB\n8SU\n5MB", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
