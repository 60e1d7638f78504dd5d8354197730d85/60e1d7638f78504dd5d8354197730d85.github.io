{"Q_ID": "1115310209", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "My Fair Coins", "Q_DESC": "\" There are coins of 2 different denominations in Crazyland, 1-cent coins and 2-cent coins. As all the coins do, even these coins have two faces, i.e. heads and tails. Your task is to find out the the number of ways to create a linear arrangement of these coins so that their sum is N cents. The only condition on the linear arrangement is that the first coin in the arrangement should always face heads. All other coins could either face head or face tail.\n\nTake N = 2 as an example. The possible arrangements are (1H, 1H), (2H), (1H, 1T), where H is heads and T is tails. Therefore there are 3 possible arrangements that sum up to 2-cents.\n\nNote\n\nWhile counting make sure that you count heads and tails as different.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of cases.\n\nT lines follow, each containing a single number N, the required sum.\n\nConstraints\n\n0 <= T <= 10000\n\n1 <= N <= 1000000000\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of such arrangements possible. As this can be very large print it modulo 1000000007.
