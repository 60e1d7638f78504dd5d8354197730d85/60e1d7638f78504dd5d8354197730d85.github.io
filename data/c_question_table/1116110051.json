{"Q_ID": "1116110051", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "Akhil And Colored Balls", "Q_DESC": "Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of W and B, where W denotes a white colored ball and B a black colored.\n\nOther than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized.\n\nHamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between WBB, BWB is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ.\n.\n\nAs there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:\nFirst line of each test case will contain a string X denoting the arrangement of balls in first row\nSecond line will contain the string Y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the string of length N denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row Z.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 =T= 3\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points) : 1= N =16\nSubtask #2 (20 points) : 1= N =103\nSubtask #3 (70 points) : 1= N =105\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\nWBWB\nWBBB\n\nOutput:\nBWBW\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1. As we know, Hamming Distance(WBWB, BWBW) + Hamming Distance(WBBB, BWBW) = 4 + 3 = 7.\nYou can try any other value for string Z, it will never exceed 6. \n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\nWBWB\nWBBB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBWBW", "TESTCASE_2": "1\nWBBB\nWBBB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBWWW", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nWBBB\nWWWW\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBBBB", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
