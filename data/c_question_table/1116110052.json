He takes a string and try to make a W shape out of it such that each angular point is a # character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.\n\nFor example, the W string can be formed from aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd such as:\n\n    a\n     a             d\n      a     #     d\n       a   b c   d\n        a b   c d\n         #     #\nHe also call the strings which can generate a W shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.\n\nMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):\n\nThe string S contains exactly 3 # characters. Let the indexes of all # be P1  P2  P3 (indexes are 0-origin).\nEach substring of S[0, P11], S[P1+1, P21], S[P2+1, P31], S[P3+1, |S|1] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details).\nNow, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any # symbols between the positions of the first and the second # symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the positions we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the #s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = # where P1  i  P2 or P2  i  P3.\n\nHelp Kira and he wont write your name in the Death Note", "TESTCASE_1": "1\naaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16", "TESTCASE_2": "1\nacb#aab#bab#accba\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nabc#dda#bb#bb#aca\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_4": "1\nbaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
