We need to find relation between them such that all the characters of the second string must appear in the first string sequentially (not necessarily continuously). The program should :\n\n    Print 1: if the characters in the first string appear in the same sequence as that of the second string.\n    Print 2: if the characters in the first string appear in the opposite sequence as that of second string.\n    Print 3: if the characters in the first string appear in both ie same as well as opposite sequences of the second string.\n    Print 0: if the characters in the first string dont appear in sequence of the second string. \n\n\nThe characters in the strings are case-sensitive.\nInput\n\nThe first line should give the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes input two strings.\nOutput\n\nAn integer ( 0,1,2 or 3 ) for each of the test cases. \n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nnjack njk\nanwesha awesa\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "2\nwysiwig iwi\nabcdef edba\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nabcdef adb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
