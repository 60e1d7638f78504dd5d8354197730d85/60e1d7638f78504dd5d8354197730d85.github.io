The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.\nKattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is lucky if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and unlucky otherwise. He considered the army as READY FOR BATTLE if the count of lucky soldiers is strictly greater than the count of unlucky soldiers, and NOT READY otherwise.\nGiven the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is READY FOR BATTLE or NOT READY.\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers.
