{"Q_ID": "1116210016", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "Forest Gathering", "Q_DESC": "Chef is the head of commercial logging industry that recently bought a farm containing N trees. You are given initial height of the i-th tree by Hi and the rate of growth of height as Ri meters per month. For simplicity, you can assume that all the trees are perfect cylinders of equal radius. This allows us to consider only the height of trees when we talk about the amount of wood.\n\nIn Chefs country, laws dont allow one to cut a tree partially, so one has to cut the tree completely for gathering wood. Also, laws prohibit cutting trees of heights (strictly) lower than L meters.\n\nToday Chef received an order of W meters (of height) of wood. Chef wants to deliver this order as soon as possible. Find out how minimum number of months he should wait after which he will able to fulfill the order. You can assume that Chefs companys sawing machines are very efficient and take negligible amount of time to cut the trees.\n\nInput\nThere is a single test case per test file.\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space separated integers N, W and L denoting the number of trees in the farm, the amount of wood (in meters) that have to be gathered and the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut.\n\nEach of next N lines contain two space separated integers denoting Hi and Ri respectively.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer denoting the number of months that have to pass before Chef will be able to fulfill the order.\n\nConstraints\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3 74 51\n2 2\n5 7\n2 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3 67 56\n5 3\n8 4\n6 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
