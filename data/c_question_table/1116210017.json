After the cooking, he decided to categorize each of these D dishes as special or not.A dish Si is called special if its name (i.e. the string Si) can be represented in the form of a double string by removing at most one (possibly zero) character from its name from any position.A string is called a double string if it can be represented as a concatenation of two identical, non-empty strings.e.g. abab is a double string as it can be represented as ab + ab where + operation denotes concatenation.Similarly, aa, abcabc are double strings whereas a, abba, abc are not.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer D denoting the number of dishes prepared by Chef on that day.Each of the next D lines will contain description of a dish.The i-th line contains the name of i-th dish Si.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each of the D dishes, print a single line containing YES or NO (without quotes) denoting whether the dish can be called as a special or not.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\naba\nabac\nabcd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "4\nabba\naabb\nabcc\nabab\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "4\nabcde\naaddd\nabcd\naghb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
