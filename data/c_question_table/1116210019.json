{"Q_ID": "1116210019", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "A String Game", "Q_DESC": "Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.\n\nOf course, the player that cant erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.\n\nNote that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.\n\nDetermine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string S, the string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer N. N lines follow. The i-th line contains a single string wi, the i-th word in the dictionary.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\ncodechef\n2\ncode\nchef\nfoo\n1\nbar\nmississippi\n4\nssissi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTracy\nTracy\nTeddy", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
