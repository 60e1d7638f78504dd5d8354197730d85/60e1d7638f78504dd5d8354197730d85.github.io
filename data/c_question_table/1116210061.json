Recently Chef clicked a beautiful photo, which is represented using 10 pixels in a single row. Respecting Chefgrams boolean roots, every pixel is either white or black.\n\nChefgram has N filters. Every filter is a string containing 10 symbols. Every symbol is either + or -.\n\nA + at the ith position in a filter means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will be inverted: it becomes black if it was originally white, and vice versa.\nA - at the ith position in a filter string means that if Chef applies this filter to his photo, the ith pixel will remain unchanged.\n\nChef can apply as many filters as he wants from a list. He can pick any subset of filters and consequently apply them to a photo.\n\nFor example:\n\nImagine that Chef has a photo bbwwbbwwbb (where b stands for black and w stands for white).\nHe applies filters ++--++--++, -+-+-+-+-+.\nApplying the first filter will transform his picture to wwwwwwwwww.\nApplying the second filter on the transformed picture will give Chef the picture wbwbwbwbwb.\n\nEven if Chefgram has two or more identical filters, they are still considered different!\n\nChef is extremely interested in knowing how many different subsets of all the Chefgram filters can he apply to transform his photo into 10 black pixels?
