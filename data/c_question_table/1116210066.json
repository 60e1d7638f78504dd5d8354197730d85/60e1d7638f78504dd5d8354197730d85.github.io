{"Q_ID": "1116210066", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "Chef and Words", "Q_DESC": "Nobody knows but Chef can play with words! He has a word. He claps and each letter of the word transform to another letter(independently)! All letters are only in range a-z. For each pair of symbols from a to z there is a probability that first symbol will transform into second one after clapping. Note that the symbol can also transform into the same symbol.\n\nAlso Chef has a list of words. He asks you what is the probability that after exactly K claps Chefs word will equal one of the words from list?\n\n \nInput\n\n    First line contains integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n    The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the number of words in list and number of clappings.\n    The second line contains string S denoting the Chefs word.\n    Each of the next 26 lines contains 26 space separated doubles. The jth double in the ith line denotes the probability that the ith small letter of English alphabet will transform to the jth one afterclapping. Letter a has number 1.\n    Each of the next N lines contains string si - next word from the list.\n\n \nOutput\n\n    For each test case in a single line print the probability that after exactly K clappings the Chefs word will be equal to one from the list. Answer will be considered as correct if absolute difference between the answer and correct answer is less or equal 10^(-6) \n\n \nConstraints\n\n    1  T  50\n    The total length of all words in one test file is less or equal 10^6.\n    1  |S|, |si|  3\n    1  N  10^5\n    1  K  10^9\n    0  aij  1\n    Sum of ai, 1 + ai, 2 + ... + ai, 26 = 1\n    All words contains only letters from a to z.\n\nSubtasks\n\n    Subtask 1: T  50; N  100, K  3.
