{"Q_ID": "1116210207", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "AUTOCOMPLETE", "Q_DESC": "\"Autocomplete is a program function that enables inputting the text (in editors, command line shells, browsers etc.) completing the text by its inputted part. Vasya is busy working on a new browser called 'BERowser'. He happens to be working on the autocomplete function in the address line at this very moment. A list consisting of n last visited by the user pages and the inputted part s are known. Your task is to complete s to make it an address of one of the pages from the list. You have to find the lexicographically smallest address having a prefix s.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains the s line which is the inputted part. The second line contains an integer n (1n100) which is the number of visited pages. Then follow n lines which are the visited pages, one on each line. All the lines have lengths of from 1 to 100 symbols inclusively and consist of lowercase Latin letters only.\n\nOutput\nIf s is not the beginning of any of n addresses of the visited pages, print s. Otherwise, print the lexicographically minimal address of one of the visited pages starting from s.\nThe lexicographical order is the order of words in a dictionary. The lexicographical comparison of lines is realized by the '<' operator in the modern programming languages.\n\n\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "next\n2\nnextpermutation\nnextelement\n\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nnextelement", "TESTCASE_2": "find\n4\nfind\nfindfirstof\nfindit\nfand\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nfind", "TESTCASE_3": "find\n4\nfondfind\nfondfirstof\nfondit\nfand\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nfind", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
