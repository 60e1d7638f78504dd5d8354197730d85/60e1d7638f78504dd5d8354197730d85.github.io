{"Q_ID": "1116210210", "S_NAME": "String", "Q_NAME": "Sebi and the cube", "Q_DESC": "\"Sebi likes solving Rubik's cube a lot. He spends a lot of time in getting expertize in solving not only the 3 * 3 * 3 cube, but also the cubes of higher dimensions like 4 * 4 * 4, 5 * 5 * 5 and so on.\nChefland has a very famous toy shop which sells Rubik's cubes. This shop has interesting rules. Each day it sells cubes of a fixed dimension. Sebi has to buy new cubes daily primarily due to two reasons, one he handles the cube very roughly and the other that he solves the cube so many times during the day.\nToday the shop is selling K * K * K size Rubik's cubes. In the morning, Sebi bought a cube from the shop. He had just started playing with it, suddenly his cute little sisters asked him to give them C units of the cube. Sebi's did not want to disappoint his sisters, so he immediately disassembled the cube into K * K * K units and gave C of those to his sisters.\nNow Sebi wants to solve the Rubik's cube again, so he thought of going to market and buy some cubes so that he can create a Rubik's cube from those. The newly created cube can be of any dimension. For achieving that, he can disassemble and reassemble the cubes in the way he wants, but he does not want to waste any units of the cubes.\nCan you please tell whether Sebi will be able to build such a Rubik's cube or not?\n\"\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 5\n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n3 5\n4 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO\n", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 4\n4 1\n3 2 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
