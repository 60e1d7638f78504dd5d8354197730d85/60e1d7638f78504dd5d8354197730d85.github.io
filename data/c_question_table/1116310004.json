You are also given an integer K.\n\nYou have to answer Q queries. In the ith query, two integers Li and Ri are given. Then you should print the number of substrings of S[L, R] which contain at most K 0s and at most K 1s where S[L, R] denotes the substring from Lth to Rth characters of the string S. \nIn other words, you have to count number of pairs (i, j) of integers such that L <= i <= j <= R such that no character in substring S[i, j] occurs more than K times.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and Q as described in the problem. The second line contains a string S of length N. Then the next Q lines describe the query, where the ith line of them contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print the required answer in a single line.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n1 <= T <= 105\n1 <= K <= N <= 105\n1 <= Q <= 105\n1 <= Li <= Ri <= N\nSum of N over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 105\nSum of Q over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 105\nS consists only of 0s and 1s.", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n8 2 3\n01110000\n1 4\n2 4\n5 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n5\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n8 2 5\n01110000\n1 4\n2 4\n5 8\n1 4\n2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n5\n7\n8\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n8 2 5\n01110000\n1 4\n2 4\n5 8\n1 4\n2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n5\n7\n8\n16", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
