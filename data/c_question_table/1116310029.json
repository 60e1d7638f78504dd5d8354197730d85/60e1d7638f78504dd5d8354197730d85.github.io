He was very hungry that time and wanted at least K units of honey to satisfy his hunger. He immediately went to a rectangular field of size N x M to collect some honey. He wanted to collect honey only in a special sub-rectangle which has size S x T where S=A and T=B, for some fixed A and B. He has Q queries, each query contains A, B. For each query, he wanted to know how many special sub-rectangles contain at least K units of honey.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers N, M and K(1=N, M=300, 1=K=N*M). The next N lines contain M characters (either H or .). H means there is honey in that cell, while . means there is no honey in that cell. The next line contains an integer Q (1=Q=100 000). The next Q lines contain integers A and B (1=A=N , 1=B=M).\n\nOutput\n\nThe output contains Q lines, each line contains the number of special sub-rectangles which satisfy the requirement. (The amount of honey is at least K inside the special sub-rectangle)\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n\n5 5 4\nH.H..\n..H..\nH...H\nHHHH.\nHH..H\n2\n1 1\n2 3\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n4\n\nExplanation for 2nd query\n\n#: means the chosen cell\nThe possibilities are:\n1.
