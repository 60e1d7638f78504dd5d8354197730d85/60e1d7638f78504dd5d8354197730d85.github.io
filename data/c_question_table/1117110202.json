He is the only hope to save the country from enemies as they have a new biological weapon which is so deadly that when it hits a particular area, it also wipes out the areas adjacent to it.Although if the weapon hits the water bodies, then it wont have any effect.\n\nGiven an NxM map which has NxM cells. Each cell may represent an area or a water body.\nThe weapon cannot penetrate a water body or the edges of the map. \n\nYou will be given a initial state of the country represented by an N x M grid consists of 0 or 1 representing water body and area respectively. Also there will be Q attacks of the biological weapon. After each query, you are to tell the number of areas still intact.Once an area is hit, the effect is directed to all the areas until it is stopped by a water body\n\nInput: \n\nFirst line of input contains 3 space separated integers N,M,Q where N x M is the size of the country. Q is the number of attacks.\n\nN lines follow each with M values of either 0 or 1, denoting whether that particular coordinate is a area(1) or water body(0). \n\nQ lines follow. Each line has a coordinate X,Y where the next attack takes place.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each Q, output the number of areas still existing on a single line.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1 1 1\n1 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "1 0 1\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2 1 1\n1 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
