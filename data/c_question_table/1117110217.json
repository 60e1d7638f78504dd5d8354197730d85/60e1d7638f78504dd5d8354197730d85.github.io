On every turn you may pick any two different elements Ai and Aj (i!=j), such that Ai, Aj = M, and add K to both. The game ends when you are not able to continue. That is, when there is no pair (i,j) left such that both of them are less than equal to M.\n\nLet's call two arrays different if the sum of all their elements is different. When the game ends, you note down the final array A. How many different final arrays can you have.
