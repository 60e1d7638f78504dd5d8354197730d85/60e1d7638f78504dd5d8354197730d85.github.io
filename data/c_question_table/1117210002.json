Incidentally, one of the workers at the factory was ill today, so Monk decided to step in and do her job.\n\nThe Monks Job is to Identify whether the incoming graph is a tree or not. He is given N, the number of vertices in the graph and the degree of each vertex.\n\nFind if the graph is a tree or not.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains an integer N, the number of vertices.\nSecond line contains N space-separated integers, the degrees of the N vertices.\n\nOutput:\nPrint \"Yes\" (without the quotes) if the graph is a tree or \"No\" (without the quotes) otherwise.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=N<=100\n1<=Degreei<=1000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n1 1 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
