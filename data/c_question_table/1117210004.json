{"Q_ID": "1117210004", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Rhezo and Destructive Mind", "Q_DESC": "Rhezo has bought a graph with N nodes and M edges. He has a destructive mind and often deletes some nodes(and of course its edges to other nodes of the graph).\nHe will ask you Q queries. Each query is denoted by an integer \nX, meaning that he will delete the node X. Since he has a destructive mind, he gets satisfied if the the new graph with deleted node has more number of connected components than the original graph.\n\nIf satisfied, he wants you to print Satisfied(without quotes) and the number of edges that were removed when deleting node \nX, else print Not Satisfied(without quotes). All queries are different, and the original graph is restored after each query.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains N and M as described in the problem statement. Each of the next \nM lines contain 2 integers Ai and Bi, meaning that there is an edge between node A and node \nB. Next line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next \nQ lines contain a single integer \nX as described in the problem statement.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each of the Q queries, if Rhezo is satisfied(that is the number of connected components of the new graph has increased), print Satisfied(without quotes), and the number of edges that will be deleted after a space. Else print Not Satisfied.\n\nConstraints:\n1=N,M,Q=102\n1=Ai,Bi=N\n1=X=N", "TESTCASE_1": "5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n3 5\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNot Satisfied\nSatisfied 2\nSatisfied 3\nNot Satisfied\nNot Satisfied", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "6 6\n1 3\n2 4\n3 6 \n4 5\n5 2\n6 1\n3\n1 \n6\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNot Satisfied\nNot Satisfied\nNot Satisfied", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
