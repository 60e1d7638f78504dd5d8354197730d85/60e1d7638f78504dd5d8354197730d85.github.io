Now he wants to practice some problems. So he came up with a simple problem. Firstly, he made a hash CFNction F such that:\n\nF(x) = x % 10\n\nNow using this CFNction he wants to hash N integers and count the number of collisions that will occur while hashing the integers.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, denoting the number of integers to hash.\nThe next line contains N space separated integers, denoting the integer X to hash.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print the number of collisions that will occur while hashing the integers.\n\nConstraints:\n1 = T = 10\n1 = N = 100\n0 = X = 105", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n5\n1 2 4 3 5\n4 \n1 2 3 2\n6 \n1 1 2 2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
