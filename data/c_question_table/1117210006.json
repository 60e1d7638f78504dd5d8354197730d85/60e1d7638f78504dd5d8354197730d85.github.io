Right now he is working on User Statistics.\nOne of the statistics data (Code Streak) is as follows:\n\nGiven the User Activity Data, find the maximum number of continuous correct solutions submitted by any user.\nSeems easy eh? Heres the catch! In order to maximize this number a user could have submitted a correct answer to the same problem which he has already solved. Now such cases cannot be tolerated. (See test case for clarification). \nAlso in all the continuous correct submissions multiple correct submissions to same problem should be counted only once.\n\nUser Activity Data will be as follows:\nTotal number of submissions by the user - N\nFor each submission its Submission ID - S and Result - R (Solved or Unsolved) will be given.\nSolved is represented by integer 1 and Unsolved by 0.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains integer T - number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case will contain N. Next N lines each will contain two space separated integers S and R.\n\nOuput:\nFor each test case output in a single line the required answer.\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 1000\n1 <= N <= 1000000 (106)\n1 <= S <= 1000000 (106)\n0 <= R <= 1\n\nNote: Sum of N over all the test cases in each file does not exceed 1000000 (106)", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n2\n3\n4\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "12\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n6\n1 0\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 0\n5\n1 1\n2 0\n3 1\n1 1\n2 1\n4\n1 1\n2 1\n2 1\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n2\n3\n4\n2\n3\n4\n2\n3\n4\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
