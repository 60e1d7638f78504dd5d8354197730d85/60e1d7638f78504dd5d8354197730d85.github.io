{"Q_ID": "1117210012", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Omax", "Q_DESC": "Given a matrix sized m x n, we define an O-region as a non-empty sub-block with another non-empty sub-block inside removed, such that the removed sub-block has no common boundaries with the outside. That is, the leftmost column of the removed sub-block must be different from the leftmost column of the outer sub-block, and similarly the rightmost columns, topmost rows, and bottommost rows are different. The removal of the inner sub-block leaves a region which looks like the letter O.\n\nThe value of an O-region is the sum of all numbers in the outer sub-block but not in the removed one. Your task is finding the maximal value of all O-regions appearing in the given matrix.\nInput\n\nThere are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:\n\n?         The first line contains two positive integers m, n (3 <= m, n <= 77).\n\n?         m lines follow, each containing n integers (each having an absolute value of 105 at most) describing the matrix.\n\nThe input is ended with m = n = 0.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective maximal value found.", "TESTCASE_1": "3 3\n1 1 1\n1 3 -1\n1 1 1\n4 5\n1 -2 3 -4 5\n-5 4 -3 2 -1\n1 -3 5 -7 9\n-9 7 -5 3 -1\n0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n19", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "4 4\n1 2 -5 3\n-2 4 8 7\n3 9 6 4\n1 -9 3 7\n3 3\n1 7 -3\n-2 5 1\n-7 3 6\n0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n38\n6", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
