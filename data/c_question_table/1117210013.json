{"Q_ID": "1117210013", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Colored Array", "Q_DESC": "Chef had a hard time arguing with his friend, and after getting a great old kick Chef saw a colored array withN cells, numbered from 1 to N.\n\nThe kick was so strong that Chef suddenly understood the rules of the game.\n\n?         Each cell is painted with a color. Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\n\n?         For any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\n\n?         However Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible).\n\n?         After performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color qthen Chef will receive Bi,q points.\n\nNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ...,  ", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
