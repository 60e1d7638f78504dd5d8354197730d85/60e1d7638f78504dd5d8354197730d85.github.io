This statistics is called valid if sum of all Ai is equal to 100.\n\nNow let us define rounding up of a statistics A.\n\n    If Ai is not an integer, it will be rounded up to next integer.\n    Otherwise it will be left as it is.\n\ne.g. 4.1 became 5, 4.9 became 5 but 6 will still be 6.\n\nNow let us consider a statistics B of size N in which each of Bi is an integer. Now he wants to know whether there exists some valid statistic A of size N (may contain real numbers) such that after rounding it up, it becomes same as B?\nInput\n\n    First line of input contain integer T - number of test cases.\n    For each test, case first line contains integer N - number of opinions.\n    Next line contains N integers B1, B2, ..., BN as defined in the problem.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output YES or NO denoting the answer of the problem, i.e. if there exists some statistics A which could be rounded to make it B, print YES otherwise NO.\nConstraints\n\n    1  T  50\n    1  N  10000\n    0  Bi  1000\n\nSub tasks\n\n    Subtask #1: N  100 (50 points)\n    Subtask #2: original (50 points)\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n20 20 20 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n3\n30 30 30\n4\n25 25 25 25\n2\n50 51\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3\n30 30 30\n4\n20 20 20 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\n", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
