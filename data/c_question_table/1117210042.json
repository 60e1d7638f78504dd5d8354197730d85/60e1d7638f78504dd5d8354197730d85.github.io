A few days ago he discovered for himself a very nice problem:\n\n\nYou are given an AB-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of A-s and B-s.\n\nDo you know how to solve it? Good. Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you.\n\n\nYou are given an ABC-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of A-s, B-s and C-s.\n\nA string is called AB-string if it doesnt contain any symbols except A or B. A string is called ABC-string if it doesnt contain any symbols except A, B or C.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an ABC-string S.\nOutput\n\nYour output should contain the only integer, denoting the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of A-s, B-s and C-s.\n\nThe answer can go above a 32-bit integer. Please, use 64-bit integers for storing and processing data.\nConstraints\n\n1  |S|  1 000 000; where |S| denotes the length of the given ABC-string.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "ABACABA\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "BACABACAB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "ABCDCBABC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
