{"Q_ID": "1117210201", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Move string", "Q_DESC": "Kira likes to play with strings very much. Moreover he likes the shape of 'W' very much. He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.\n\nFor example, the W string can be formed from \"aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\" such as:\n\n    a\n     a             d\n      a     #     d\n       a   b c   d\n        a b   c d\n         #     #\nHe also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.\n\nMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):\n\nThe string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1 < P2 < P3 (indexes are 0-origin).\nEach substring of S[0, P11], S[P1+1, P21], S[P2+1, P31], S[P3+1, |S|1] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details).\nNow, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the \"positions\" we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = '#' where P1 < i < P2 or P2 < i < P3.\n\nHelp Kira and he won't write your name in the Death Note.\n\nNote:\n\nFor a given string S, let S[k] denote the k+1th character of string S, and let the index of the character S[k] be k. Let |S| denote the length of the string S. And a substring of a string S is a string S[a, b] = S[a] S[a+1] ... S[b], where 0  a  b < |S|. And a subsequence of a string S is a string S[i0] S[i1] ... S[in1], where 0  i0 < i1 < ... < in1 < |S|.\n\nFor example, let S be the string \"kira\", then S[0] = 'k', S[1] = 'i', S[3] = 'a', and |S| = 4. All of S[0, 2] = \"kir\", S[1, 1] = \"i\", and S[0, 3] = \"kira\" are substrings of S, but \"ik\", \"kr\", and \"arik\" are not. All of \"k\", \"kr\", \"kira\", \"kia\" are subsequences of S, but \"ik\", \"kk\" are not.\n\nFrom the above definition of W string, for example, \"a#b#c#d\", \"aaa#yyy#aaa#yy\", and \"o#oo#ooo#oooo\" are W string, but \"a#b#c#d#e\", \"#a#a#a\", and \"aa##a#a\" are not.\n\nInput                                           Each line contains a string S.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer, denoting the length of the longest W string as explained before. If S has no W string as its subsequence, then output 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16", "TESTCASE_2": "acb#aab#bab#accba\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10", "TESTCASE_3": "abc#dda#bb#bb#aca\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
