{"Q_ID": "1117210201", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Move string", "Q_DESC": "Kira likes to play with strings very much. Moreover he likes the shape of 'W' very much. He takes a string and try to make a 'W' shape out of it such that each angular point is a '#' character and each sides has same characters. He calls them W strings.\n\nFor example, the W string can be formed from aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd such as:\n\n    a\n     a             d\n      a     #     d\n       a   b c   d\n        a b   c d\n         #     #\nHe also call the strings which can generate a 'W' shape (satisfying the above conditions) W strings.\n\nMore formally, a string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand):\n\nThe string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1  P2  P3 (indexes are 0-origin).\nEach substring of S[0, P11], S[P1+1, P21], S[P2+1, P31], S[P3+1, |S|1] contains exactly one kind of characters, where S[a, b] denotes the non-empty substring from a+1th character to b+1th character, and |S| denotes the length of string S (See Note for details).\nNow, his friend Ryuk gives him a string S and asks him to find the length of the longest W string which is a subsequence of S, with only one condition that there must not be any '#' symbols between the positions of the first and the second '#' symbol he chooses, nor between the second and the third (here the positions we are looking at are in S), i.e. suppose the index of the '#'s he chooses to make the W string are P1, P2, P3 (in increasing order) in the original string S, then there must be no index i such that S[i] = '#' where P1  i  P2 or P2  i  P3.\n\nHelp Kira and he won't write your name in the Death Note.\n\nNote:\n\nFor a given string S, let S[k] denote the k+1th character of string S, and let the index of the character S[k] be k. Let |S| denote the length of the string S. And a substring of a string S is a string S[a, b] = S[a] S[a+1] ... S[b], where 0  a  b  |S|. And a subsequence of a string S is a string S[i0] S[i1] ... S[in1], where 0  i0  i1  ...  in1  |S|.\n\nFor example, let S be the string kira, then S[0] = 'k', S[1] = 'i', S[3] = 'a', and |S| = 4. All of S[0, 2] = kir, S[1, 1] = i, and S[0, 3] = kira are substrings of S, but ik, kr, and arik are not. All of k, kr, kira, kia are subsequences of S, but ik, kk are not.\n\nFrom the above definition of W string, for example, a#b#c#d, aaa#yyy#aaa#yy, and o#oo#ooo#oooo are W string, but a#b#c#d#e, #a#a#a, and aa##a#a are not.\n\nInput                                           Each line contains a string S.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer, denoting the length of the longest W string as explained before. If S has no W string as its subsequence, then output 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16", "TESTCASE_2": "acb#aab#bab#accba\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10", "TESTCASE_3": "abc#dda#bb#bb#aca\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
