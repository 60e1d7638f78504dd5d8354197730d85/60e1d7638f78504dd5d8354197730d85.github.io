T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n - the number of tickets on the table. n lines will follow. Each of these lines contains three integers: Pi, Ai and Bi.\nOutput\n\nOutput T lines, each containing a single real number - answer for the corresponding test case. Rounding errors less than 10-6 will be ignored.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n50 1 2\n50 2 1\n3\n100 1 3\n47 2 1\n74 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0.500000000\n0.347800000", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n3\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n8 9 10\n4\n12 3 3\n23 4 4\n11 22 11\n12 3 4\n2\n1 1 1\n1 3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1.000000000\n0.000000000\n0.010000000", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
