{"Q_ID": "1117310026", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Little Elephant", "Q_DESC": "Little Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes to paint.\n\nHe has n objects to paint, ordered in a row and numbered form left to right starting from 1. There are totally c colors, numbered from 0 to c-1. At the beggining all objects are colored in color with number 1. When object with color a is painted in color b, the resulting color will have number (a*b) mod c.\n\nLittle Elephant is going to make k turns. At i-th (0-based numeration) turn he will randomly choose any subset (even empty) of objects with indices in range [Li; Ri] (inclusive) and paint all objects in chosen subset with random color (the same for all objects in the subset).\n\nLittle Elephant wants to know the expected sum of all colors over all n objects after making all k turns. Help him.\nInput\n\nFirst line contain single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains three integers n, c and k. Next k lines of each test case contain k pairs of integers Li and Ri, one pair per line.\nOutput\n\nIn T lines print T real numbers - the answers for the corresponding test cases.\n\nAny results within 10^-6 absolute error will be accepted.\nConstraints\n\n1 = T = 10\n\n1 = n, k = 50\n\n2 = c = 100\n\n1 = Li = Ri = n ", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3 7 3\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6.000000000", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n3 6 3\n1 1\n3 3\n4 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4.500000000\n", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4 3 4\n1 2\n2 4\n3 3\n1 4\n7 10 7\n7 7\n3 4\n1 2\n5 5\n4 5\n2 7\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3.444444444\n22.943125000", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
