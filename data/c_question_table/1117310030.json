For each query of type 1, next two integers denote Xi, Yi.\n    For each query of type 2, next two integers denote Ci, Di.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query of type 2, print the required answer in a single line.\nConstraints\n\n    0  Ai  9\n    1  Xi  N\n    0  Yi  9\n    1  Ci  Di  N\n\nSubtasks\n\n    Subtask #1 (10 points): 1  N, M  103 and only type 2 queries.\n    Subtask #2 (15 points): 1  N, M  103\n    Subtask #3 (20 points): 1  N, M  105 and only type 2 queries\n    Subtask #4 (55 points): 1  N, M  105\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5 3\n01245\n2 1 3\n1 4 5\n2 3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "4 2\n0124\n2 2 4\n2 4 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "4 2\n3567\n2 1\n2 3\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
