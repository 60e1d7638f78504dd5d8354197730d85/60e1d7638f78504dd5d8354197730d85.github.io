Each line in the next N - 1 lines contains a pair of integer u and v representing a edge between this two vertices.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer Q which is the number of the queries. Each line in the next Q lines contains three integers r, u, v representing a query.\n\n \nOutput\n\nFor each query, write out the answer on a single line.\nConstraints\n\n20 points:\n\n    1  N, Q  100\n\n \n\n40 points:\n\n    1  N, Q  105\n    There is less than 10 unique value of r in all queries\n\n \n\n40 points:\n\n    1  N, Q  2  105\n\n \n", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n2\n1 4 2\n2 4 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n1 2\n2 2\n1 3\n2\n1 3 1\n2 3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n1 1\n2 2\n1 2\n2\n1 3 1\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
