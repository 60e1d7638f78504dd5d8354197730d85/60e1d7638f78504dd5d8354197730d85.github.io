{"Q_ID": "1117310039", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Number of Factors", "Q_DESC": "Alice has learnt factorization recently. Bob doesnt think she has learnt it properly and hence he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a product of N numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your task is simple. Given N numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of these N numbers.\nInput:\n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test starts with a line containing a single integer N.\nThe next line consists of N space separated integers (Ai).\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, output on a separate line the total number of factors of the product of given numbers.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1  T  100\n1  N  10\n2  Ai  1000000\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n3 5 7\n3\n2 4 6\n2\n5 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n10\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n6\n3 5 4  2 7 8\n2\n10 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n56\n12", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n4 5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n16", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
