You found the following note slipped under your hotel room door the next day:\n \"Salutations, new friend! I have replaced every digit of my phone number with its spelled-out uppercase English representation (\"ZERO\", \"ONE\", \"TWO\", \"THREE\", \"FOUR\", \"FIVE\", \"SIX\", \"SEVEN\", \"EIGHT\", \"NINE\" for the digits 0 through 9, in that order), and then reordered all of those letters in some way to produce a string S. It's up to you to use S to figure out how many digits are in my phone number and what those digits are, but I will tell you that my phone number consists of those digits in nondecreasing order. Give me a call... if you can!\"\n You would to like to call your friend to tell him that this is an obnoxious way to give someone a phone number, but you need the phone number to do that! What is it?\nInput\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each consists of one line with a string S of uppercase English letters.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is a string of digits: the phone number.\nLimits\n1 <= T <= 100.\nA unique answer is guaranteed to exist.\nSmall dataset\n3 <= length of S <= 20.\nLarge dataset\n3 <= length of S<= 2000.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\nOZONETOWER\nWEIGHFOXTOURIST\nOURNEONFOE\nETHER\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n012\n2468\n114\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "3\nEERTH\nIGHTE\nENIN\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n8\n9", "TESTCASE_3": "9\nENO\nOWT\nEERTH\nRUOF\nEVIF\nXIS\nVENES\nTGHIE\nENIN\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
