{"Q_ID": "1117310207", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Teddy and Tracy", "Q_DESC": "Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.Of course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner. Note that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R. Determine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\ncodechef\n2\ncode\nchef\nfoo\n1\nbar\nmississippi\n4\nssissi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTracy\nTracy\nTeddy", "TESTCASE_2": "4\nCODEDEBUG\n3\ncode\nDE\nBUG\n1\nbar\nmississippi\n4\nssissi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTeddy\nTracy\nTracy\nTracy", "TESTCASE_3": "3\ncoddecheg\n2\ncodde\nchef\ngoo\n1\ncar\nmippippissi\n4\nppippi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTeddy\nTracy\nTeddy", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
