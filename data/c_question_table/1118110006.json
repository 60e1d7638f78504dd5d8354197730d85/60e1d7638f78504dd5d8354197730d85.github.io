{"Q_ID": "1118110006", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "Time Machine Difference", "Q_DESC": "\nThe Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.\n\nThe Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions. Now kindly help our Captain of the Ship \"H.G.Wells\" to calculate the difference between the two time machines.\n\nMandatory:\n\n1. Create a Structure \"Time\" and three data members as seconds(int), minutes(int), hours(int)\n\n2. The Structure Variables as \"startTime, stopTime, diff\"\n\nNote: The  structure variables, data members and structure name are CASE Sensitive.\n\nFollow the same case mentioned in the mandatory", "TESTCASE_1": "12 34 55\n8 12 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTIME DIFFERENCE=12:34:55-8:12:15=4:22:40", "TESTCASE_2": "5 34 55\n10 12 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTIME DIFFERENCE=5:34:55-10:12:15=-5:22:40", "TESTCASE_3": "11 34 55\n10 12 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTIME DIFFERENCE=11:34:55-10:12:15=1:22:40", "TESTCASE_4": "15 34 55\n10 12 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTIME DIFFERENCE=15:34:55-10:12:15=5:22:40", "TESTCASE_5": "stopTime.seconds\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nstartTime.hours"}
