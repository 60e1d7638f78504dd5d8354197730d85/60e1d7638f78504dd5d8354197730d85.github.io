{"Q_ID": "1118110039", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "TRANSFORMATION", "Q_DESC": "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written 3  4 + 5 would be written 3 4  5 + first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that. \nTransform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form. \nYou can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c) \nInput\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then 100). \nFollowed by t lines, containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400. \nOutput\nThe expressions in RPN form, one per line.\nExample\nInput:\n3\n(a+(b*c))\n((a+b)*(z+x))\n((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))\n\nOutput:\nabc*+\nab+zx+*\nat+bac++cd+^*\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n(a+(b*c))\n((a+b)*(z+y))\n((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nabc*+\nab+zy+*\nat+bac++cd+^*", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n(a+(b*c))\n((a+b)*(z+y))\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nabc*+\nab+zy+*", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
