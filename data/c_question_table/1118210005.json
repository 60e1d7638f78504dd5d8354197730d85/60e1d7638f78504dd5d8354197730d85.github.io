You are given N points with integers coordinates, Chef asks you to find out how many points he should add to these set of N points, so that one could create at least one square having its vertices from the points of the resulting set. Note that the square created need not to be parallel to the axis.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains singe integer N.\n\nEach of next N lines contains two integers Xi and Yi denotine the coordinates of i-th point.\nOutput\n\nIn a single line print single integer - the minimal number of points Chef need to paint to receive at least one square.\nConstraints\n\n    0=N=2000\n    -10^6=Xi, Yi=10^6\n    There are NO coincided points\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example Chef can add points (2, 0), (0, 2) or (2, 3), (3, 2)\n\nFor the second example Chef already has square (0, 0), (100, 0), (0, 100), (100, 100).\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n0 0\n2 2\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n0 0\n100 100\n200 200\n100 0\n0 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
