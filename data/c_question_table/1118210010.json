He needs to worry if the new restaurant can possibly be targetting his chefs .\n\nIn short given a tree T and another tree O you need to tell whether O is a subtree of T or not . The node values of T or O need not be distinct as they represent the age of the Chef . Also , a subtree of a rooted tree includes a particular node and the entire tree structure below it .\n\nTwo trees A and B are considered same if age(A->root ) = age(B->root) and subtree rooted at A->left is same as subtree rooted at B->left and subtree rooted at A->right is same as subtree rooted B->right .\nInput\n\n?
