{"Q_ID": "1118210034", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "Buying Sweets", "Q_DESC": "Banknotes in the state of Strangeland dont have any regulated values like 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc. In fact, its possible to see any positive integer on a banknote of Strangeland. Indeed, this isnt the most convenient thing.\n\nAnn is working as a sweet seller at a shop in Strangeland. Every kind of sweets in this shop has its own cost, and sweets of the same kind have the same cost.\n\nCustomers in Strangeland are strange. A customer points at some kind of sweets and gives several banknotes to the seller. This means that he wants to buy a positive number of sweets of that kind. He doesnt tell the exact number of sweets he wants to buy. The only thing Ann knows is: an adequate customer wont give any extra banknotes. It means that if you throw away any banknote, the resulting amount of money wont be enough to buy the wanted number of sweets.\n\nAnn has to determine the number of sweets the customer wants. Help Ann write a program which determines this number or tells that its impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases (no more than 20). T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first of these lines contains two integers N and X (1 <= N, X <= 100) separated by a single space. N is the number of banknotes given by the customer. X is the cost of a single sweet of the chosen kind. The second of these lines contains N space-separated integers Ai (1 <= Ai <= 100), the values of the banknotes.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output exactly one line containing a single integer:\n\n    -1 if the customer is inadequate and has given extra banknotes, or\n    K, the number of sweets the customer wants to buy. If there are several possible answers, output the largest of them.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n4 7\n10 4 8 5\n1 10\n12\n2 10\n20 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n1\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4 7\n10 4 8 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n2 10\n20 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
