He wants to put maximum number candies in each box. Since you are really good at mathematics, so he has asked you to find the maximum number of candies K that he can put in each box.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, number of test cases. Description of each test contains 2 lines. First line contains single integer N, number of boxes. Next line contains N integers. i th number denoting C[i], the number of candies in each box .\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output the maximum number of candies each box will contain after transferring candies, K.\n\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=T=100\n1= N=10^4\n1=C[i]=10^9", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n3 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n3\n3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
