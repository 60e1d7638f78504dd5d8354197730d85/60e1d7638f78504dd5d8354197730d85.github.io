{"Q_ID": "1118210036", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "Chef and math", "Q_DESC": "Chefs team is going to participate at the legendary math battles. One of the main task in the competition is to calculate the number of ways to create a number by adding some Chefonacci numbers. A number is called a Chefonacci number if it is an element of Chefonacci sequence defined as follows.\n\nf(0) = 1; \nf(1) = 2; \nFor i > 1 : f(i) = f(i - 1) + f(i - 2)\n\nChef asked you to help him with this task. There will be Q question of form X, K : How many different ways are there to create X by adding K Chefonacci numbers. Note that the order of numbers in the addition does not matter, i.e. (f(i) + f(j) + f(k)) and (f(j) + f(i) + f(k)) will not be counted as distinct ways. Also note that you are allowed to use a Chefonacci number any number of times (zero or more).\n\nAs the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer Q denoting number of questions Chef was asked.\n\nIn the next Q lines follow the questions, i-th of the line will denote the i-th question represented by two space separated integer X, K respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each question, output a separate line containing the answer of the question.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\nSubtask 1 : [10 points]\n1 <= Q <= 50\n1 <= X <= 109\n1 <= K <= 4\n\n\nSubtask 2 : [20 points]\n\n1 <= Q <= 100\n1 <= X <= 109\n1 <= K <= 5\n\n\nSubtask 3 : [20 points]\n\n1 <= Q <= 100\n1 <= X <= 102\n1 <= K <= 10\n\n\nSubtask 4 : [50 points]\n\n1 <= Q <= 100\n1 <= X <= 109\n1 <= K <= 10", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n12 1\n13 1\n13 2\n13 3\n13 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n1\n2\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n12 1\n13 1\n13 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n12 1\n14 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
