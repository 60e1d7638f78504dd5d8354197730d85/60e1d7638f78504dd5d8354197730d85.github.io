{"Q_ID": "1118210037", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "ChefTown Parade", "Q_DESC": "ChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1<=i<=N) there is exactly one building with height i. The buildings are located in a single line from left to right. The height of ith building is H(i). The Mayor of ChefTown wants to organize a parade, where all great chefs will take part. A parade depends of its location. The location of a parade is a segment of consecutive buildings beginning near the building number L and ending near the building number R (1<=L<=R<=N). Any parade wont be interesting if it is not hold on an interesting segment of buildings. The segment of buildings is interesting if following are hold:\n\n         Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R].\n\n         Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.\n\n         Lets sort B in non-decreasing order.\n\n         Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2<=i<=K).\n\nNow the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1L2 or R1R2.\nInput\n\nEach input file consists of two lines, the first one contains two integers N and W (1<=N<=400000, 1<=W<=N). The second line contains N numbers H(i) (1<=i<=N) - the heights of the buildings.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer - the number of interesting segments of buildings of length W.", "TESTCASE_1": "2 1\n2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 2\n1 2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "3 1\n2 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
