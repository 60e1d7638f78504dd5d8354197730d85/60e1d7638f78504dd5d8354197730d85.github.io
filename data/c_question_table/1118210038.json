In other words, sequence s can be obtained from the a by deleting some elements.\n\nSequence s[1],s[2],...,s[k] is called an arithmetic progression, if it can be represented as :\n\ns[1]=p, where p  some integer;\ns[i]=p+(i-1)q (i>1), where q  some integer.\nIn particular, the empty sequence or a sequence of one element is an arithmetic progression.\n\n \n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n  the number of elements in the sequence. The next line of the test case contains n integer, a[1],a[2],...,a[n]  elements of the sequence.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the remainder of the division the answer on 1000000007 (10^9+7). All answers print on different lines. \n\nConstraints\n\n 1<=T<=10\n\n 1<=n<=200000\n\n 1<=a[i]<=100", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n1\n1\n3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4\n1 5 6 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n5\n5 6 7 1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
