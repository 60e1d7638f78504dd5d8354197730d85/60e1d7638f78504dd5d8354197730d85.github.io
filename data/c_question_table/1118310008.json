To shuffle the cards we repeat the following steps M times:\ntake A cards from the top of the deck.\ntake another B cards from the top of the deck.\nput the A cards, which you removed in the first step, back on top of the remaining deck.\ntake C cards from the deck\nput the B cards, which youre still holding from the second move, card by card on top of the deck.\nfinally, return the block of C cards on top\nNote: taking a block of cards from the top of the deck does not change their order. The entire block is removed in a single move and not card by card. The only exception is the fifth move, where you return cards one by one from the top.", "TESTCASE_1": "10 2\n6 2 2\n5 3 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 8 7 3 9 6 5 4 10", "TESTCASE_2": "10 1\n6 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 8 7 3 4 5 6 9 10", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
