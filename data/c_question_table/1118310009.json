By the way, Im referring to the popular South Asian snack, Samosa. I guess its hard to code while thinking of Samosa, especially if you are very hungry now ; so lets not get in to any recipe or eating game.\nYou have N boxes of Samosas, where each box is a cube. To pack a box, you need to use a rubber band ( pseudo-circular, elastic band ) by placing it around the box ( along 4 faces of the cube ). A (R1,R2)-rubber band has initial radius R1 and it can stretch at max to radius R2 without breaking. You can pack a cubical box of side length L using a rubber band of circumference 4 * L ( see Notes for clarity). Given M rubber bands along with their initial radius and max radius, we need to match ( assign ) some rubber bands to boxes. A box needs at least one rubber band to pack it and of course, each rubber band can be used to pack at most one box. Find the maximum number of boxes we can pack. \n\nNotes\nA pseudo-circular rubber band having a radius R has circumference of 2 * K * R , where K is a constant = 22 / 7. So, a (R1,R2) rubber band can be used to pack a cubical box of side length L, only if 2 * K * R1 <= 4 * L <= 2 * K * R2", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n10 20 34 55\n4\n7 14\n7 21\n14 21\n7 35\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n4\n10 20 34 55\n4\n7 14\n6 18\n14 21\n8 24\n3\n22 26 37 60\n3\n4 12\n8 24\n5 35\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n0 ", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
