{"Q_ID": "1118310013", "S_NAME": "Structures and Unions", "Q_NAME": "Receipt Recovery", "Q_DESC": "While vacationing in Egypt, Chef found a recipe of an ancient dish. The receipt is a sequence of hieroglyphs written on a magic paper - it survived for thousands of years! The sequence is written on a long scroll. Unfortunately, the scroll is split into pieces, and possibly, some pieces of the scroll are missing. Chef has a total of N pieces, numbered for convenience from 1 to N. He gave the pieces of a tape to his friend who studies hieroglyphs for analysis. Chef was happy to hear that there are some relations between the pieces. Some of the pieces may follow other pieces.\n \nThe informations about these relations is given as a list of M pairs (Ai, Bi). Such a pair means that the Aith piece can be immediately followed by the Bith one.\n \nChef is working on recovering the recipe to prepare this dish for his Egyptian friends. He wants to place all the pieces into lines such that any pair of consecutive pieces (L, R) in a line must be explicitly allowed by one of the M rules described above. In other words, for some i (1 ? i ? M), (Ai, Bi) = (L, R). It appears that in general, not all the pieces can be placed in a single line while following the rules. So, please help Chef find what is the minimum number of lines required for all the pieces to be placed acoording to the rules.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n5 4\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
