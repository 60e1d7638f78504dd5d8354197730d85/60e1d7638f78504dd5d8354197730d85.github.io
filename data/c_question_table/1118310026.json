However, she finds writing story so boring that, after working for three hours, she realized that all she has written are M long words consisting entirely of letters A and B. Having accepted that she will never finish the story in time, poor Bavi has decided to at least have some fun with it by counting bubbly words.\n\nNow Bavi is connecting pairs of identical letters (A with A, B with B) by drawing arches above the word. A given word is bubbly if each letter can be connected to exactly one other letter in such a way that no two arches intersect. So here is your task. Help Nikki count how many words are bubbly.\n\nInput :\n\nThe first line of input contains the positive integer M , the number of words written down by Nikki. Each of the following M lines contains a single word consisting of letters A and B, with length between 2 and 10^5, inclusive. The sum of lengths of all words doesnt exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput :\n\nThe first and only line of output must contain the number of bubbly words.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= M <= 100\n\nNote: You may or may not use Structures or union for the program.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\nABAB\nAABB\nABBA\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "3\nAAA\nAA\nAB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nABBABB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
