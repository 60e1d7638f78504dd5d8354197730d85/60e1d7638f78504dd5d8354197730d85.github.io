There are N positive integers in that array. Dheena loved the array so much that he started to spend a lot of time on it everyday. One day, he wrote down all possible subsets of the array. Then for each subset, he calculated the sum of elements in that subset and wrote it down on a paper. Unfortunately, Dheenalost the beautiful array :(. He still has the paper on which he wrote all subset sums. Your task is to rebuild beautiful array A and help the couple stay happy :)\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains one integer N, the number of elements in A.\nSecond line of each test case contains 2^N integers, the values written on paper\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one line with N space separated integers in non-decreasing order.\nConstraints\n\n    1 = T = 50\n    1 = N = 15\n    0 = Values on paper = 10^9\n    All input values are valid.
