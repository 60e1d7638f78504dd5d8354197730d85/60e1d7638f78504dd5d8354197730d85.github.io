{"Q_ID": "1119110070", "S_NAME": "Pointers", "Q_NAME": "AMELIA DICE", "Q_DESC": "Amelia designed a game of triangle with 2 players. She names the points of her triangle as p1,p2 and p3. She moved over her coin in these points. She used a special dice which could bring out numbers from 1 to 100. In every move if the number of the dice takes moves in multiple of 3, the player scores additional 10 points.  Amelia wants to write a C program to pick out numbers that are multiple of 3 using the concept of arrays and pointers. Your task is to help her write the code using pointers and arrays and print the numbers divisible by 3. The array contains the sequence of numbers occuring in the dice.                                                                                                                                              \nInput :  \nThe first line contains the no of test cases,  0<T<=10000, \nThe Second line contains the no of array elements n of test case 1,   0<n<=100, \nThe third line contains the n integers separated by a space.           \nFor T test cases the second and third lines are successively entered.                                        \n\nOutput:  \nThe number that is divisible  by 3,    \n If T <0  or T>10000    \nprint \" Invalid Input\"   .     \n If n<0 or n>100 print \"Invalid Input\"              ", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n5\n1 12 3 4 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n3\n15", "TESTCASE_2": "10001\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nInvalid Input", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
