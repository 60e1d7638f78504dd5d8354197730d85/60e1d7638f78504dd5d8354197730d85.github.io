The no of array elements n  defines the no of products oliver wants to imporve sale, and m defines the growth percentage : an integer 0n=50 and  0m=10,    The third line contains the n integers a1,a2, a3, ...anseparated by a space defining the previous sales of each item.     For T test cases the second and third lines are successively entered.                                        Output:  Each item sales improved by a factor of m.  [ m times ai]  If T 0  or T5000    print  Invalid Input   .
