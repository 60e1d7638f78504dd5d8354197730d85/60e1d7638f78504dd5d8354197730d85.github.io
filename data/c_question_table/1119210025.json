{"Q_ID": "1119210025", "S_NAME": "Pointers", "Q_NAME": "Approximately ", "Q_DESC": "Chef has recently learnt some new facts about the famous number . For example, he was surprised that ordinary fractions are sometimes used to represent this number approximately. For example, 22/7, 355/113 or even 103993/33102.\n\nSoon, by calculating the value of 22/7 and 355/113 on paper Chef became quite disappointed because these values are not precise enough. For example, 22/7 differs in the third digit after the decimal point. So, these values are definitely should not be used for serious calculations.\n\nHowever, Chef doesnt know anything about 103993/33102. This fraction is quite inconvenient to calculate on paper. Chef is curious how precise this value is. So he asks you to help him and to calculate the first K digits after the decimal point of such an approximation of . He consider this ordinary fraction as infinite decimal fraction so formally he asks you to calculate this approximation truncated to the first K digits after the decimal point.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer K.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the value of 103993/33102 truncated to the first K digits after the decimal point. Note that for K = 0 you should output just 3 without decimal point (quotes are for clarity).\nConstraints\n\n    0  K  106\n    1  T  2000\n    The sum of K over the input does not exceed 106", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n0\n6\n20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3.141592\n3.14159265301190260407", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n0\n6\n20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3.141592\n3.14159265301190260407", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n0\n6\n20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3.141592\n3.14159265301190260407", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
