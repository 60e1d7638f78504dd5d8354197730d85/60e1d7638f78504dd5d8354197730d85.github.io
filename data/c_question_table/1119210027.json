Hes played N practice matches in all.\n\nHe wants to convince the coach and the manager that hes improved over time and that his injury no longer affects his game. To increase his chances of getting back into the team, hes decided to show them stats of any 2 of his practice games. The coach and manager will look into the goals scored in both the games and see how much hes improved. If the number of goals scored in the 2nd game(the game which took place later) is greater than that in 1st, then he has a chance of getting in. Tell Rayne what is the maximum improvement in terms of goal difference that he can show to maximize his chances of getting into the team. If he hasnt improved over time, hes not fit to play.
