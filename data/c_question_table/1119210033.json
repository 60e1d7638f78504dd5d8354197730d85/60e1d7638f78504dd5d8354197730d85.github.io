It has 54 places numbered consecutively from 1 to 54, some of which are already booked and some are still free. The places are numbered in the following fashion:\n\nThe car is separated into 9 compartments of 6 places each, as shown in the picture. So, the 1st compartment consists of places 1, 2, 3, 4, 53 and 54, the 2nd compartment consists of places 5, 6, 7, 8, 51 and 52, and so on.\n\nA group of X friends wants to buy tickets for free places, all of which are in one compartment (its much funnier to travel together). You are given the information about free and booked places in each of the N cars. Find the number of ways to sell the friends exactly X tickets in one compartment (note that the order in which the tickets are sold doesnt matter).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers X and N (1  X  6, 1  N  10) separated by a single space. Each of the following N lines contains the information about one car which is a string of length 54 consisting of 0 and 1. The i-th character (numbered from 1) is 0 if place i in the corresponding car is free, and is 1 if place i is already booked.\nOutput\n\nOutput just one integer -- the requested number of way", "TESTCASE_1": "1 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n85", "TESTCASE_2": "6 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3 2\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n360", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
