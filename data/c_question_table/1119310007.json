{"Q_ID": "1119310007", "S_NAME": "Pointers", "Q_NAME": "Number of Ways", "Q_DESC": "Devu is learning Combinatorics in his college. He find it very interesting to calculate number of ways of going to point (c,d) from point (a,b) in co-ordinate plane. We can take horizontal and vertical steps only and can not visit at a point twice. In a step, you can move one unit only. We have to reach to the point (c,d) from the point (a,b) using abs(a-c)+ abs(b-d) steps only.\n\nDevu has two sets of points. Set A contains points having X co-ordinate 0 and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Set B contains points having X co-ordinate K and Y co-ordinates varying from 1 to N(both inclusive). Both sets contains N number of integral points. He wants to calculate the sum of number of ways to going to the each point of set B from the each point of set A .\n\nAs the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.\nNext T lines will contain pair of integers N and K\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 2\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n236", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n10 9\n1 3\n2 8\n10 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n335910\n1\n20\n587850", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
