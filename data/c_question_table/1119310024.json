Your job is to form a rectangle with the biggest possible area, using these sticks as the perimeter. You are allowed to glue sticks together, but you are not allowed to break a single stick into multiple shorter sticks. For example, if there are 11 sticks, you can create a 2 x 3 rectangle using 10 sticks. This rectangle has an area of 6 square inches, which is the biggest area that can be achieved in this case.\nInput\n\nInput will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly\none number N ,the number of stick.\n-N will be between 4 and 5000\n\nOutput\n\nFor every number N, output a single line containing the maximal area (in square inches) of a rectangle", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n14\n10\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n6\n756", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n14\n10\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n6\n756", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n14\n10\n111\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n6\n756", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
