This statistics is called valid if sum of all Ai is equal to 100.\nNow let us define rounding up of a statistics A.\n If Ai is not an integer, it will be rounded up to next integer.\n Otherwise it will be left as it is.\ne.g. 4.1 became 5, 4.9 became 5 but 6 will still be 6.\nNow let us consider a statistics B of size N in which each of Bi is an integer. Now he wants to know whether there exists some valid statistic A of size N (may contain real numbers) such that after rounding it up, it becomes same as B?\nInput\n First line of input contain integer T - number of test cases.\n For each test, case first line contains integer N - number of opinions.\n Next line contains N integers B1, B2, ..., BN as defined in the problem.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output YES or NO denoting the answer of the problem, i.e. if there exists some statistics A which could be rounded to make it B, print YES otherwise NO.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3\n30 30 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4\n25 25 25 25\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n2\n50 51\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
