Each test case consists of T lines consisting of YES or NO.\nIf a test case accurately represents the output that you would print for this file,\nthen print YES for this case. Print NO otherwise.\n\nThe output for a file is defined as the output for all the test cases one by one. If you output YES for test case x, then your output\nmust match the input for the test case x, and if and only if your output does not match the input for test case x, should you print NO\nfor that case.\nInput\n\nThe first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains T lines. Each line is either YES or NO. The T lines together represent the candidate output for this problem.\nOutput\n\nIf the candidate-output (that you got in the input) is what you are going to print then print YES, and\nonly if it is different, print NO. The output for each case must be on a single line by itself.\nConstraints\n\n1  T  100\nThere is only one unique valid output that you can print\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "2\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "2\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
