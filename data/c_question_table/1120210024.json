{"Q_ID": "1120210024", "S_NAME": "Practice Session", "Q_NAME": "Trees and Subtrees", "Q_DESC": "The Head Chef has a reporting hierarchy for his chefs which is basically a binary tree i.e. Each chef reports to exactly one chef and every chef can take reporting of atmost two chefs . In case two chefs report to the same chef they must report at different times . The time of reporting can have only two values : Morning or Evening ( denoted by M and E , respectively ) .The Head Chef himself is not part of the reporting structure . The Head Chef has found that a new restaurant in Byteland is opening and it is hiring a group of chefs from some existing restaurant . The new restaurant will basically make an offer to one of the chefs and all the chefs directly or indirectly reporting to the chef . The Head Chef is worried that the new restaurant may be taking away some of his chefs . The Head Chef knows that the new restaurant will not change the reporting structure of the chefs . The Head Chef also has access to the reporting structure of the new restaurant in terms of ages of Chefs . The Head Chef wants to know whether there is a need to worry or not . He needs to worry if the new restaurant can possibly be targetting his chefs .\n\nIn short given a tree T and another tree O you need to tell whether O is a subtree of T or not . The node values of T or O need not be distinct as they represent the age of the Chef . Also , a subtree of a rooted tree includes a particular node and the entire tree structure below it .\n\nTwo trees A and B are considered same if age(A-root ) = age(B-root) and subtree rooted at A-left is same as subtree rooted at B-left and subtree rooted at A-right is same as subtree rooted B-right .\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in Head Chefs restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by number 1 to N .\nThe next N lines contain ages of the chefs with the i th line containing the age of chef i .\nThe next N - 1 lines contain two integers A and B and a character C which is either M or E where A denotes the senior chef and B denotes the reporting chef , and the character C denotes the time of reporting .\nThe next line of the input contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries/possible structures of chefs of new restaurant . This is followed by description of Q queries .\nThe first line of each query contains an integer M denoting the number of chefs in new restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by numbers 1 to M.\nThe next M lines contain the ages of the chefs with the i th line denoting the age of chef i .\nThe next M - 1 lines contain two integers A and B and a character C which is either M or E where B denotes the reporting chef and A denotes the chef who takes the reporting , and the character C denotes the time of reporting .\nOutput\n\nFor each test case answer YES or NO as applicable .\nConstraints\n\n2 = N = 100000\n1 = M = 1000\n1 = Q = 200\n1 = Age of Chef = 100", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1 2 M\n1 3 E\n2 4 E\n3 5 M\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1 2 M\n2\n1\n1\n1 2 M\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1 2 M\n1 3 E\n2 4 E\n3 5 M\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1 2 M\n2\n1\n1\n1 2 M\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "11 45 78 96 65 253 41 52 63 52\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n78 52 96 52", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
