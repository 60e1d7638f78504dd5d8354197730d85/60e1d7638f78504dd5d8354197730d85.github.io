Today, the store received N orders.\nIts known that the amount of tips may be different when handled by different delivery man.\nMore specifically, if Andy takes the ith order, he would be tipped Ai dollars and if Bob takes this order,\nthe tip would be Bi dollars.\n\nThey decided that they would distribute the orders among themselves to maximize the total tip money. One order will be handled by only\none person. Also, due to time constraints Andy cannot take more than X orders and Bob cannot take more than\nY orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be handled\nby either Andy or Bob.\n\nPlease find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money after processing all the orders.\nInput\n\n    The first line contains three integers N, X, Y.\n    The second line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Ai.\n    The third line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Bi.\n\nOutput\n\n    Print a single integer representing the maximum tip money they would receive.\n\nConstraints\n\nAll test:\n\n    1 = N = 105\n    1 = X, Y = N; X + Y  N\n    1 = Ai, Bi = 104\n\n10 points:\n\n    1 = N = 20\n\n30 points:\n\n    1 = N = 5000\n\n60 points:\n\n    1 = N = 105\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5 3 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n21", "TESTCASE_2": "5 3 3\n11 12 13 14 15\n5 3 6 2 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n52", "TESTCASE_3": "5 4 5\n2 4 3 6 8 \n5 3 6 2 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
