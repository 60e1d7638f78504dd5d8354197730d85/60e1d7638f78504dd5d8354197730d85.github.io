{"Q_ID": "1120310057", "S_NAME": "Practice Session", "Q_NAME": "STAR SYSTEM", "Q_DESC": "Did you hear about Zeta Reticuli ? Its a star system deep in the southern sky, and this is where the first Alien film is set. Zetas are the aliens living there and they like playing games with humans. This year they selected Nancy and took her with them to play the famous Zeta-Nim game. Given N piles of stones and a value K, each pile i has a counter Ci which is the maximum number of stones that can be removed from it. Initially, Ci = K for 0 = i  N. Each turn involves selecting one of the N piles, say pile i, and removing R ( 1 = R = Ci ) stones from it and updating Ci = R. In other words, the number of stones removed from a pile should not be more than the number of stones removed from the same pile before, starting with removal of at most K stones.\n\nZeta and Nancy take turns alternately and the one who can not remove any more stones lose. Given N, K and the number of stones in each of the N piles, find who wins the game if both play optimally and Nancy starts first.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. Each case contains 2 lines. First line contains N K and the second line contains the array A of N space separated integers. A[i] is the number of stones in the ith pile.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the winners name Nancy or Zeta ( without quotes ).\nConstraints\n\n1 = T = 200\n1 = N = 50\n1 = A[i] = 2012\n1 = K = 100,000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 1\n3\n2 2\n3 3\n5 10\n5 10 15 20 25\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNancy\nZeta\nNancy", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n1 1\n3\n2 2\n4 4\n5 9\n15 20 25 30 35\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNancy\nZeta\nNancy", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 1\n3\n3 3\n6 6\n5 9\n15 20 25 30 35\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNancy\nNancy\nNancy", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0 ###---###SEPERATOR---###--- 0"}
