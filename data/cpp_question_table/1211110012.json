{"Q_ID": "1211110012", "S_NAME": "Input and Output", "Q_NAME": "BUZZ - CPPIOU005", "Q_DESC": "In the standard version of the math game Buzz, players begin counting and whenever a player reaches a number that has seven as a digit or is divisible by seven, he says \"Buzz\" instead of the number. Numbers such as seventy require the player to say \"Buzz Buzz\".\nOnce because the number contains the digit \"7\" and once because the number is divisible by \"7\". However, if one of the two properties holds more than once (for example, the number 771 contains the digit 7 twice) the player only says \"Buzz\" once for each property that holds. \n\nSRM team is about to participate in the game of Buzz and the SRM Buzz team coach requests you to help him in automating this training program by writing a program. \n\nCan you please help him out? \nGiven an input integer, write a program to print the number and the number of times the word buzz needs to be said. \n\nInput Format : \nInput consists of a single integer. \n\nOutput Format : \n\nRefer sample input and output for formatting specifications. \n\nSample Input 1:\n777\nOutput 1: BuzzBuzz \n(Reason: Divisible by 7 and has a digit 7)\n\nSample Input 2:\n63\nOutput 2: Buzz\n(Reason: Divisible by 7 but doesn't has a digit  7 So only once)\n\nSample Input 3:\n55\nOutput 3: Sorry \n(Reason: Neither divided by 7 nor has the number 7)\n\nSample Input 4:\n72\nOutput 4: Buzz\n(Reason: Not Divisible by 7, but has a digit \"7\")\n\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "70\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBuzzBuzz", "TESTCASE_2": "33\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorry", "TESTCASE_3": "71\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBuzz", "TESTCASE_4": "63\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBuzz", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
