{"Q_ID": "1211210044", "S_NAME": "Input and Output", "Q_NAME": "Mixtures", "Q_DESC": "Harry Potter has n mixtures in front of him, arranged in a row.Each mixture has one of 100 different colors (colors have numbers from 0 to 99).\n\nHe wants to mix all these mixtures together. At each step, he is going to take two mixtures that stand next to each other and mix them together, and put the resulting mixture in their place.\n\nWhen mixing two mixtures of colors a and b, the resulting mixture will have the color (a+b) mod 100.\n\nAlso, there will be some smoke in the process. The amount of smoke generated when mixing two mixtures of colors a and b is a*b.\n\nFind out what is the minimum amount of smoke that Harry can get when mixing all the ixtures together.\n\nInput\nThere will be a number of test cases in the input.\n\nThe first line of each test case will contain n, the number of mixtures, 1 <= n <= 100.\n\nThe second line will contain n integers between 0 and 99 - the initial colors of the mixtures.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum amount of smoke.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n18 19\n3\n40 60 20\n\nOutput:\n342\n2400\nIn the second test case, there are two possibilities:\n\nfirst mix 40 and 60 (smoke: 2400), getting 0, then mix 0 and 20 (smoke: 0); total amount of smoke is 2400\nfirst mix 60 and 20 (smoke: 1200), getting 80, then mix 40 and 80 (smoke: 3200); total amount of smoke is 4400\nThe first scenario is the correct approach since it minimizes the amount of smoke produced.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n18 19\n3\n40 60 20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n342\n2400", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n18 22\n3\n40 90 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n396\n3500", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n18 22 43 22 31\n3\n40 90 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4097\n3500", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
