The following operations are counted as 'steps':\n\nemptying a vessel,\nfilling a vessel,\npouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty.\nInput\nAn integer t, 1=t=100, denoting the number of test cases, followed by t sets of input data, each consisting of three positive integers a (the number of liters the first container can hold), b (the number of liters the second container can hold), and c (the final amount of liters of water one vessel should contain), not larger than 40000, given in separate lines.\n\nOutput\nFor each set of input data, output the minimum number of steps required to obtain c liters, or -1 if this is impossible.\n\nExample\nSample input:\n2\n5\n2\n3\n2\n3\n4\nSample output:\n2\n-1", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5\n2\n3\n2\n3\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n-1", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5\n3\n3\n9\n3\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3\n3\n3\n9\n3\n9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
