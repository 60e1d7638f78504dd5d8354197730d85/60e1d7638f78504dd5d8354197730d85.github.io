Find the total ways to construct buildings in the plots such that there is a space between any 2 buildings. All plots on one side of the road are continuous.\nLets suppose * represents a plot, then for N=3, the plots can be represented as * * * | | * * *                               \n\nWhere | | represents the road.                                                                                                                                                                  \nNote: As the answer can be very large, print it mod 1000000007\n\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains T denoting number of test cases. Only line of each test case contains one integers N, as described above.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single line containing one integer, the answer to the above problem.\n\nConstraints:\n1<= T <= 100000\n1<= N <= 105\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n25", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
