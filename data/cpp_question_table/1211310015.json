{"Q_ID": "1211310015", "S_NAME": "Input and Output", "Q_NAME": "Pyramid form", "Q_DESC": "We have N stones of various heights laid out in a row. By taking some consecutive section of the stones, we wish to form a pyramid, where the height of the stones start from 1, increase by 1, until it reaches some value x, then decreases by 1 until it reaches 1 again i.e. the stones should be 1, 2, 3, 4x  1, x, x  1, x  2  1. All other stones not part of the pyramid should have a height 0. We cannot move any of the stones from their current position, however, by paying a fee of 1, we can reduce the heights of the stones. We wish to minimize the cost of building a pyramid. Output the minimum cost to build this pyramid. Assume that always a pyramid would be made of the input elements.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the array. The last line of input contains n space separated integers forming the array.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the minimum cost to build this pyramid.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10^5\n1<=n<=10^5\n1<=a[i]<=10^5", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n6\n1 2 3 4 2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n3\n1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
