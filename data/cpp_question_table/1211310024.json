You have to print the size of the largest subsequence of string A such that all the characters in that subsequence are distinct ie. no two characters in that subsequence should be same.\nA subsequence of string A is a sequence that can be derived from A by deleting some elements and without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T, number of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single string in one line. Each character of the string will be a small alphabet(ie. 'a' to 'z').\n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print the required answer in one line.\n\nConstraints\n1  T  10\nSubtask 1 (20 points):1  N  10\nSubtask 2 (80 points):1  N  105", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nabc\naba\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "1\nabbbcd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "3\naccb\naaab\nbbbccae\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
