Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\nChef has a positive integer N. He can apply any of the following operations as many times as he want in any order:\n Add 1 to the number N.\n Take some digit of N and replace it by any non-zero digit.\n Add any non-zero leading digit to N.\n\nFind the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N without leading zeros.\nOutput\nFor each T test cases print one integer, the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number.\nConstraints\n1  T  10\n1  N < 10100000\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n25\n46\n99\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n67\n23\n77\n88\n7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n0\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n70\n98\n7\n8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
