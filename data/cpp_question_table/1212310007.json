Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.\nOutput\nFor each test case write the determined value in a separate line.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n1\n2 1\n1 2 3\n4 \n1 \n1 2 \n4 1 2\n2 3 1 1 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n9", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n3\n1\n2 1\n3 2 1\n5\n1 \n1 2\n2 1 4\n5 6 3 2 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n10\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n5\n1\n1 2\n3 0 1\n5\n4\n1 5\n2 1 4\n7 8 9 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
