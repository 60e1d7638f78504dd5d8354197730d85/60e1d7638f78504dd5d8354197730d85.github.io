{"Q_ID": "1212310010", "S_NAME": "Control Statements", "Q_NAME": "Chef and Bipartite Graphs", "Q_DESC": "Chef is very interested in studying biparite graphs. Today he wants to construct a bipartite graph with n vertices each, on the two parts, and with total number of edges equal to m. The vertices on the left are numbered from 1 to n. And the vertices on the right are also numbered from 1 to n. He also wants the degree of every vertex to be greater than or equal to d, and to be lesser than or equal to D. ie. for all v, d  deg(v)  D\n\nGiven four integers, n, m, d, D, you have to help Chef in constructing some bipartite graph satisfying this property. If there does not exist any such graph, output -1\n.\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains four space separated integers n, m, d, D.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output -1 if there is no bipartite graph satisfying this property. Otherwise output m lines, each of the lines should contain two integers u, v denoting that there is an edge between vertex u on the left part and vertex v on the right part. If there can be multiple possible answers, you can print any. Note that the bipartite graph should not have multi-edges.\nConstraints\n\n    1  T, n  100\n    1  d  D  n\n    0  m  n * n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 3 1 2\n2 3 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2\n2 1\n1 1\n-1", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n4 5 1 3\n4 1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n1 3\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4 5 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n1 3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
