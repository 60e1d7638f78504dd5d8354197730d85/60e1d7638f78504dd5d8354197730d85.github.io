{"Q_ID": "1212310020", "S_NAME": "Control Statements", "Q_NAME": "Breaking Into Atoms", "Q_DESC": "Let X be the set of all integers between 0 and n-1. Suppose we have a collection S1, S2, ..., Sm of subsets of X. Say an atom A is a subset of X such that for each Si we have either A is a subset of Si or A and Si do not have any common elements.  Your task is to find a collection A1, ..., Ak of atoms such that every item in X is in some Ai and no two Ai, Aj with i  j share a common item. Surely such a collection exists as we could create a single set {x} for each x in X. A more interesting question is to minimize k, the number of atoms.  Input The first line contains a single positive integer t  30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets Si. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer vi between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of Si. Following this are vi distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of Si.  You are guaranteed that 1  n  100 and 1  m  30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set Si.  Output For each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 2\n3 0 1 2\n3 2 3 4\n4 3\n2 0 1\n2 1 2\n2 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5 2\n2 1 0 2\n4 3 2 1\n4 3\n3 2 2\n2 3 2\n4 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
