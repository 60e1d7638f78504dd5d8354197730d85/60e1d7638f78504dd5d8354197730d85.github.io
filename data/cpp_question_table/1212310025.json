One of their specialties is related to producing offsprings. A cow in FooLand produces its first calve (female calf) at the age of two years and proceeds to produce other calves (one female calf a year).\n\nNow the farmer Harold wants to know how many animals would he have at the end of N years, if we assume that none of the calves die, given that initially, he has only one female calf?\n\n \n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each line of the test case contains a single integer N as described in the problem.\n \n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print in new line the number of animals expected at the end of N years modulo 10^9 + 7.\n \n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= T <= 10^3\n\n1 <= N <= 10^18", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2\n6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n13", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
