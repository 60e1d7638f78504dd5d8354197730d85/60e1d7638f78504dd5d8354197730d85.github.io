Now you are given time for insertion, deletion and copying. You need to output minimum time to write N characters on the screen using these operations.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of same characters to write on screen. The next line contains time for insertion, deletion and copying respectively.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the minimum to write N characters on the screen.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=100\n1<=N<=100\n1<=insert,remove,copy<=N", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n9\n1 2 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n10\n2 5 4\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n14", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n8\n1 9 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
