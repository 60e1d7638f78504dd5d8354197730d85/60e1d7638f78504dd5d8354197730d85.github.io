{"Q_ID": "1213110026", "S_NAME": "Strings", "Q_NAME": "WORD EQUIVALENT OF A CHECK AMOUNT ", "Q_DESC": "Writing the Word Equivalent of a Check Amount) Continuing the discussion of the previous example, we reiterate the importance of designing check-writing systems to prevent alteration of check amounts. One common security method requires that the check amount be written both in numbers, and spelled out in words as well. \n\nEven if someone is able to alter the numerical amount of the check, it is extremely difficult to change the amount in words.\n\nMany computerized check-writing systems do not print the amount of the check in words. Perhaps the main reason for this omission is the fact that most high-level languages used in commercial applications do not contain adequate string manipulation features. \n\nAnother reason is that the logic for writing word equivalents of check amounts is somewhat involved.\n\nWrite a program that inputs a numeric check amount and writes the word equivalent of the amount. For example, the amount 112.43 should be written as\n      ONE ONE TWO and 43/100\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "44.34\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFOURFOUR Dollars\n34/100", "TESTCASE_2": "89.43\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nEIGHTNINE Dollars\n43/100", "TESTCASE_3": "112.43\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nONEONETWO Dollars\n43/100", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
