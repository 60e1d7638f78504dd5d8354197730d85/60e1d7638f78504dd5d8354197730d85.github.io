{"Q_ID": "1213310001", "S_NAME": "Strings", "Q_NAME": "LONGEST PALINDROMIC SUBSTRING", "Q_DESC": "Take a group of letters or a meaningful string which need not be essentially a meaningful word. Let N be Number of test cases. Read the string and search for the palindrome. If a palindrome is longer than the previous palindrome found. Take the longer one as result and print its length. Print the longest palindromic substring. NOTE: More than one valid answer is also possible. INPUT FORMAT: Lets be the string. Assume that the maximum length of s is 1000. OUTPUT FORMAT: Print the longest possible palindromic substring. EXPLANATION: Group the letters making a string. The string taken is not conditioned to make a meaningful word. In that string print the substring which is palindromic. Possibility of forming two palindromic substring can also be done.", "TESTCASE_1": "Malayalam\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLongest palindrome substring is: alayala\nLength is: 7", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
