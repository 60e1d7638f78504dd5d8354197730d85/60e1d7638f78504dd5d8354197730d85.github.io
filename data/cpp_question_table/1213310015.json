Note that we will not consider ABCD as a common child because C doesn't occur before D in the second string.\n\nInput format\n\nTwo strings, a and b, with a newline separating them.\n\nConstraints\n\nAll characters are upper cased and lie between ASCII values 65-90. The maximum length of the strings is 5000.\n\nOutput format\n\nLength of string S.", "TESTCASE_1": "HARRY\nSALLY\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "SHINCHAN\nNOHARAAA\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "AA\nBB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
