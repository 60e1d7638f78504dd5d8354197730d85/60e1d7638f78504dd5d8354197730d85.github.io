{"Q_ID": "1216110049", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Collisions", "Q_DESC": "Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x.\n\nYou know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter.  \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively.\nEach of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.   \n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.   \n\nConstraints\n1<=  T <= 100\n1<=  N, M <= 10", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4 3\n111\n100\n110\n000\n2 2\n10\n01\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4 3\n111\n100\n110\n000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n2 2\n10\n01\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
