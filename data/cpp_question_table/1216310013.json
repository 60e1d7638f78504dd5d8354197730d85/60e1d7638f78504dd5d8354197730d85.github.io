It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n11 11\n12 12\n13 13\n14 14\n15 15          \n300\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n65", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n11 111\n12 121\n13 133\n14 144\n15 155\n300\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n21 111\n22 121\n13 13\n14 144\n15 155\n400\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n71", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
