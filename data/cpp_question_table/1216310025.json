He greatly desired the Princess of Mathematics  Facie. However, before accepting his hand in marriage, Facie asked Prima to solve the following problem:   The figure below shows a simple multiplication problem. However, not all the decimal digits are available. Prima has to find an assignment of digits to the marked places so that the multiplication is valid.    \n\nDigits can appear only in places marked by `*'. Of course, leading zeroes are not allowed. Write a program to help Prima that will find all solutions to this problem for any subset of digits from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Input The first line contains N, the number of digits that will be used  The second line contains N space separated digits  Output A single line with the total number of unique solutions.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n2 3 4 6 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n2 3 4 5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
