{"Q_ID": "1216310027", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Richie Rich", "Q_DESC": "Sandy likes palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, madam is a palindrome.On her 7th  birthday, Sandy's uncle, Richie Rich, offered her an 'n' digit check which she refused because the number was not a palindrome. Richie then challenged Sandy to make the number palindromic by changing no more than digits. Sandy can only change 1  digit at a time, and cannot add digits to (or remove digits from) the number.Given k  and an n -digit number, help Sandy determine the largest possible number she can make by changing =k digits.Note: Treat the integers as numeric strings. Leading zeros are permitted and can't be ignored (So 0011 is not a palindrome, 0110 is a valid palindrome). A digit can be modified more than once.Input Format\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers,n  (the number of digits in the number) and  k (the maximum number of digits that can be altered), respectively. \nThe second line contains an -n digit string of numbers that Sandy must attempt to make palindromic.Output Format\n\nPrint a single line with the largest number that can be made by changing no more than  k digits; if this is not possible, print -1.", "TESTCASE_1": "4 1\n3943\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3993", "TESTCASE_2": "6 3\n092282\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n992299", "TESTCASE_3": "4 1\n0011\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
