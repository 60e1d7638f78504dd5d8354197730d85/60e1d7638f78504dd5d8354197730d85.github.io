{"Q_ID": "1217110020", "S_NAME": "Pointers", "Q_NAME": "Game of divisors", "Q_DESC": "Mike and his friend Tom are playing a very interesting game right now. Here is the description of the game:\n\nInitially, there is a positive integer N written on the desk, which is strictly greater than 1; Mike makes the first move, then players make moves alternatively;\nOn each move the current player can either decrease the number on the desk by 1, or divide it by one of it's divisors except itself and 1; It's forbidden to decrease the number if it's equal to 1;  If the current player can't make a move, then he loses. In other words, if there is 1 written on the desk right before his move, then he loses.\nYou are given a number N. You need to determine the winner of the game, if N is the number written of the desk initially. You may assume, that both players play optimally.\n\nInput:\n\nThere are multiple test cases in the input. The first line of the input contains one integer T, denoting the number of test cases in the input.\nThe next T lines contain one integer each, denoting the initial number of the game.\nAll the test cases are independent and must be considered separately!\n\nOutput:\n\nYour output should contain exactly T lines, each contains the name of the winner(Mike or Tom) of the corresponding game. You should output the verdicts of the games in the order they appear in the input.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n5\n3\n2\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTom\nTom\nMike\nMike", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n5 \n4 \n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTom\nMike\nMike", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMike\nMike", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
