For example, the strings \"abc\" and \"abca\" suit him, while the string \"aba\" doesn't. He also want the number of letters 'c' in his string to be as little as possible.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains single integer n (1<=n<=2 10 power 5)  the length of the string.\n\nOutput\nPrint the string that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\naa", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nbba", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
