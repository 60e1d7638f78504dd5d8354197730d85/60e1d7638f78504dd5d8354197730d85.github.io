Valentine's day is coming and he wants to gift her some jewellery.\n\nHe bought n pieces of jewellery. The i-th piece has price equal to i+1, that is, the prices of the jewellery are 2,3,4,... n+1.\n\nWatson gave Sherlock a challenge to color these  jewellery pieces such that two pieces don't have the same color if the price of one piece is a prime divisor of the price of the other piece. Also, Watson asked him to minimize the number of different colors used.\n\nHelp Sherlock complete this trivial task.\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains single integer n (1<=n<=100000)  the number of  jewellery pieces.\n\nOutput\n\nThe first line of output should contain a single integer k, the minimum number of colors that can be used to color the pieces of  jewellery with the given constraints.\nThe next line should consist of n space-separated integers (between 1 and k) that specify the color of each piece in the order of increasing price.\nIf there are multiple ways to color the pieces using k colors, you can output any of them.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1 1 2", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1 1 2 1", "TESTCASE_3": "17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
