However, its doors were firmly locked and even Obelix had no luck opening them.\n\nA little later they found a string s, carved on a rock below the temple's gates. Asterix supposed that that's the password that opens the temple and read the string aloud. However, nothing happened. Then Asterix supposed that a password is some substring t of the string s.\n\nPrefix supposed that the substring t is the beginning of the string s; Suffix supposed that the substring t should be the end of the string s; and Obelix supposed that t should be located somewhere inside the string s, that is, t is neither its beginning, nor its end.\n\nAsterix chose the substring t so as to please all his companions. Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose the longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the substring t aloud, the temple doors opened.\n\nYou know the string s. Find the substring t or determine that such substring does not exist and all that's been written above is just a nice legend.\n\nInput\nYou are given the string s whose length can vary from 1 to 106 (inclusive), consisting of small Latin letters.\n\nOutput\nPrint the string t. If a suitable t string does not exist, then print Just a legend without the quotes.", "TESTCASE_1": "fixprefixsuffix\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nfix", "TESTCASE_2": "abcdabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nJust a legend", "TESTCASE_3": "qwertyqwertyqwerty\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nqwerty", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
