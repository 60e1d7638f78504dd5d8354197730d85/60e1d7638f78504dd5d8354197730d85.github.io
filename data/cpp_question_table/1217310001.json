{"Q_ID": "1217310001", "S_NAME": "Pointers", "Q_NAME": "Winner Is Here", "Q_DESC": "Winter is here at the North and the White Walkers are close. John Snow has an army consisting of n soldiers. While the rest of the world is fighting for the Iron Throne, he is going to get ready for the attack of the White Walkers.\n\nHe has created a method to know how strong his army is. Let the i-th soldiers strength be ai. For some k he calls i1,i2,...,ik a clan if i1i2i3...ik and gcd(ai1,ai2,...,aik)1 . He calls the strength of that clan kgcd(ai1,ai2,...,aik). Then he defines the strength of his army by the sum of strengths of all possible clans.\n\nYour task is to find the strength of his army. As the number may be very large, you have to print it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nGreatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of integers is the maximum possible integer so that each element of the sequence is divisible by it.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains integer n (1n200000)  the size of the army.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1ai1000000)  denoting the strengths of his soldiers.\n\nOutput\nPrint one integer  the strength of John Snow's army modulo 1000000007 (109+7).", "TESTCASE_1": "2 2\n1 99\n100 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "10 1\n100 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "123 2\n78 10\n130 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
