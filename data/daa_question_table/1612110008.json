{"Q_ID": "1612110008", "S_NAME": "Sorting Techniques", "Q_NAME": "Grovyle String", "Q_DESC": "Trico is trying to impress a girl. But the girl is not showing any sign of interest to him. So his best friend suggested him to gift one Grovyle string to her. Grovlye string is a odd length string consisting of only lowercase alphabets arranged in such a way that a number X associated with it is smallest as possible.\n\nX is calculated as : First take absolute distance of each character's position from the center of the string i.e., (string length/2) and then multiply the distance with its ASCII value. Similarly find all the values and add them.\n\nExample : Given string : aaa\n\nHere only one unique permutation is possible : aaa\n\ndistances are : for first a, d1 = 1, second a, d2 =0, third a, d3 = 1;\n\nso X = 1 X 97 + 0 X 97 + 1 X 97 = 194;\n\nSo given a string of odd length consisting of only lowercase alphabets, find one permutation of the given string such that X is smallest as possible. And if there are many such strings then print the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nInput: First line contains T, the number of test cases that follow. Next T lines, each contains one odd length string consisting of only lowercase alphabets.\n\nOutput: For each test case, print the desired result in separate lines.\n\nConstraints:\n1 = T = 1000 \n0 = String Length = 1001", "TESTCASE_1": "2\naaa\nabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\naaa\nacb", "TESTCASE_2": "3\naaa\nabc\nccb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\naaa\nacb\nbcc", "TESTCASE_3": "5\naaa\naca\naba\nacc\nabb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\naaa\naca\naba\nacc\nabb", "TESTCASE_4": "7\nada\nscs\nscc\nasa\nabh\nabb\nacd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nada\ncss\ncsc\nasa\nahb\nabb\nadc", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
