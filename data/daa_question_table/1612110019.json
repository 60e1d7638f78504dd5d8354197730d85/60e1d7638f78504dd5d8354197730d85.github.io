You are also given the value of K i.e. the total kilometers a car can drive on each sub-track. \n\nIf the car can't cover a sub-track, you can add any unit of Petrol in it. With each unit of petrol added, the total kilometers your car can travel will increase by one unit .\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers (A[])  denoting the distance of each N sub-tracks.\n\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case in a new line you have to print out the minimum unit of Petrol your car require to cover all the sub-tracks. If no extra unit of petrol is required, print -1.\n\nConstraints:\n1=T=100\n1=N,K=200\n1=A[]=1000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 7\n2 5 4 5 2\n5 4\n1 6 3 5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5 7\n2 5 4 5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4 7\n2 3 4 5 \n4 3\n4 1 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n6 2\n2 3 1 2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
