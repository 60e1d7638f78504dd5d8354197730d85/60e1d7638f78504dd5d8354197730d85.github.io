{"Q_ID": "1613110002", "S_NAME": "Divide and Conquer", "Q_NAME": "Pebbles Game", "Q_DESC": "Given 2N pebbles of N different colors, where there exists exactly 2 pebbles of each color, you need to arrange these pebbles in some order on a table. You may consider the table as an infinite 2D plane.\n\nThe pebbles need to be placed under some restrictions :\n\nYou can place a pebble of color X, at a coordinate (X,Y) such that Y is not equal to X, and there exist 2 pebbles of color Y.\nIn short consider you place a pebble of color i at co-ordinate (X,Y). Here, it is necessary that (i=X) , (i!=Y) there exist some other pebbles of color equal to Y.\n\nNow, you need to enclose this arrangement within a boundary , made by a ribbon. Considering that each unit of the ribbon costs M, you need to find the minimum cost in order to make a boundary which encloses any possible arrangement of the pebbles. The ribbon is sold only in units (not in further fractions).\n\nInput Format:\n\nFirst line consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M.\n\nThe next line consists of N space separated integers, where the ith integer is A[i], and denotes that we have been given exactly 2 pebbles of color equal to A[i]. It is guaranteed that A[i]!=A[j], if i!=j\n\nOutput Format:\n\nPrint the minimum cost as asked in the problem in a separate line for each test case.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=T=50\n3=N=10^5\n1=M=10^5\n1=A[i]=10^6 \n\n where 1=i=N", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3 5\n1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n35", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n2 8\n1 2 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n24", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n2 6\n3 2 5\n2 5 2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n18", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n2 8\n5 2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n72", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
