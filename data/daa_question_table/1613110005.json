It's Pros and Cons Time!\n\nThere is a long list of n girls in front of Barney, and he is to calculate the optimal happiness he can find by selecting exactly 2 girls. (Why 2? No one knows!)\n\nTed, as a fan of pros and cons, suggests to make a list, a method for estimating the maximum happiness that Barney can achieve.\n\nEach girl is characterized by two parameters:\n\n- favour: if this girl is chosen, his happiness increases by this amount. \n- anger: if this girl is not chosen, his happiness decreases by this amount.\n\nFind the maximum happiness that Barney can obtain. Note that the answer is allowed to be negative.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input file contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases to follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n, as explained in statement. It is followed by n lines, each containing two space-seperated integers denoting the favour and anger of the ith girl.\n\nOutput:\nThe output file should contain t lines, each containing answer for the test case.\n\nConstraints:\n1 = t = 10\n2 = n = 1e^5\n0 = favour[i], anger[i] = 1e^9\nNone of the input files exceed 4MB.", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n2 3\n10 2\n11 5\n4 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n2\n3 1\n4 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4\n9 8\n10 7\n12 8\n5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n5\n5 3\n8 9\n10 6\n12 9\n4 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
