{"Q_ID": "1613110006", "S_NAME": "Divide and Conquer", "Q_NAME": "Game Of Strengths", "Q_DESC": "Andrew is very fond of Maths.He has N boxes with him,in each box there is some value which represents the Strength of the Box.The ith box has strength A[i]. He wants to calculate the Overall Power of the all N Boxes.\n\nOverall Power here means Sum of Absolute Difference of the strengths of the boxes(between each pair of boxes) multiplied by the Maximum strength among N boxes. Since the Overall Power could be a very large number,output the number modulus 10^9+7(1000000007).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T test cases. Each test case has 2 lines. First line contains the number of boxes N. It is followed by a line containing N elements where ith element is the strength of Andrew's ith box.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single number, which is the Overall Power for that testcase.\n\nConstraints\n\n1<=T<= 10\n\n2<=N<=10^5\n\n0<=A[i]<=10^9", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3\n3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2\n1 2\n5\n4 5 3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n100", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n2\n2 3\n4\n4 2 5 1\n5\n4 3 5 2 1\n3\n2 4 1\n2\n5 1\n4\n5 1 4 2\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n70\n100\n24\n20\n70", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n5\n3 5 1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n90", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
