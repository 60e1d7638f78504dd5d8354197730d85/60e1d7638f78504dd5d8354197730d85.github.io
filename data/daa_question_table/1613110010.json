You will be given the weight of luggage of each friend in the array Weight, where Weight i  is the weight of luggage of ith friend carried by Puchi on ith day. It is given that all the luggages carried by Puchi are distinct in their weights. \n\nAs Prateek assigned this job to Puchi, so for each day, he wants to know the number of days in future when Puchi will have to carry the luggage , having weight less than the weight of luggage of current day.\nPlease help Prateek for the same.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. In each test case, the following input will be present: \nFirst line contains an integer N, where N represents the number of friends.\nNext N line contains N integers, where ith line contains ith integer, which represents Weight i.\n\nOutput:\nOutput exactly T lines. Each line contains N integer separated by a space, where ith integer represents the number of luggage of future, which are less than the weight of luggage of the current day.\n\nConstraints:\n\nSubtask 1:\n1 = T = 30\n1= N = 10^4\n1= Weight i = 10^6 \n\nSubtask 2:\n1 = T = 10\n1= N = 10^5\n1= Weight i = 10^6", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n2\n1\n4\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 1 0", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n3\n7\n4\n9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4\n3\n4\n1\n6\n7\n1\n3\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 0 0 ", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n2\n4\n3\n1\n5\n4\n3\n1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 ", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
