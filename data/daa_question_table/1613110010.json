In each test case, the following input will be present: \nFirst line contains an integer N, where N represents the number of friends.\nNext N line contains N integers, where ith line contains ith integer, which represents Weight i.\n\nOutput:\nOutput exactly T lines. Each line contains N integer separated by a space, where ith integer represents the number of luggage of future, which are less than the weight of luggage of the current day.\n\nConstraints:\n\nSubtask 1:\n1 = T = 30\n1= N = 10^4\n1= Weight i = 10^6 \n\nSubtask 2:\n1 = T = 10\n1= N = 10^5\n1= Weight i = 10^6", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n2\n1\n4\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 1 0", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n3\n7\n4\n9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4\n3\n4\n1\n6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 0 0", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n2\n4\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
