Every other Prince wants to marry her.The Code King invites all the other Prince in the town for a RACE and the winner of the race gets a chance to marry her.\n\nObviously , the RACE will be full of hurdles. Given the number of Princes N, each with ID (0 to N-1) and their maximum jumping strengths (A[i] : i = 0,1,...,N-1) and the number of hurdles K, each with its height ( D[i] : i = 0,1,...K-1) in the RACE, find the winner !!\n\nThe Prince who crosses maximum number of levels wins the RACE. In case of ties, the Prince with minimum ID wins the RACE.\n\nfor further clarification refer the testcases.\n\nINPUT:\nFirst line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases .\nfirst line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K denoting the total number of Princes and the number of hurdles.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains N space separated integers A[0],A[1],...,A[N-1] denoting princes jumping strength.\n\nThe third line of the each test case contains K space separated integers D[0],D[1],..,D[K-1] denoting height of hurdle i.\n\nOUTPUT:\noutput a single integer denoting the ID of the winning prince.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n\n1<=t<=50\n1 <= N <= 10^6\n1 <= K <= 10^6\n0 <= A[i] <= 10^9\n0 <= D[i] <= 10^9", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 5\n10 20 30 40 50\n7 7 7 7 7\n7 5 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n2 1 5 1 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4 4 \n1 2 3 4 \n2 1 5 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n5 5\n20 30 10 50 40\n4 4 4 4 4\n7 5 \n2 1 3 5 4 6 7\n2 1 5 1 8\n3 3\n4 5 6\n4 3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n3\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
