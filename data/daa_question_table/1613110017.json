Also, N students will arrive one-by-one and take a seat.\n\nEvery student has a preferred row number(rows are numbered 1 to M and all rows have a maximum capacity K. Now, the students come one by one starting from 1 to N and follow these rules for seating arrangements: \nEvery student will sit in his/her preferred row(if the row is not full).\n\nIf the preferred row is fully occupied, the student will sit in the next vacant row. (Next row for N will be 1)\nIf all the seats are occupied, the student will not be able to sit anywhere.\nMonk wants to know the total number of students who didn't get to sit in their preferred row. (This includes the students that did not get a seat at all)\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains 3 integers N, M and K. N - Number of students and M - Number of rows and K - maximum capacity of a row.\nNext line contains N space separated integers Ai. \nAi - preferred row of ith student.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the total number of students who didn't get to sit in their preferred row.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=N,M<=10^5\n1<=K<=500\n1<=Ai<=M", "TESTCASE_1": "5 2 2\n1 1 2 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 3 2\n1 1 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "5 4 2\n1 1 2 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
