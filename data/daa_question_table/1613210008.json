{"Q_ID": "1613210008", "S_NAME": "Divide and Conquer", "Q_NAME": "Monk meets Dynamic Array", "Q_DESC": "In order to explore new things, Monk went to see the Algo Show, where he saw a dynamic array A1,A2...AN. The array made the show very interesting, by processing Q operations on itself.\n\nThe operations are of following two types: \n1 X : means push element X at the back of the array.\n2 : means pop the last element of the array.\n\nNote: It is guaranteed that, no pop operation will be applied on the empty array in the given input.\n\nIn order to make the show more interactive, after preforming each operation, the array asked the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the resulting array from the audience.\nBeing greedy for fame in the new world, Monk wants to answer all of the questions asked by the dynamic array. \nHelp Monk for the same.\n\nINPUT:\nFirst line of input will consists two integers N and Q. Next line will consists of N integers denoting the initial array. Next Q line will consists of operations described above.\n\nOUTPUT:\nAfter each operation, output the length of Longest increasing subsequence of the resulting array in new line.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1  N  10^6\n1  Q  10^6\n1  Ai,x  10^6", "TESTCASE_1": "4 3\n1 2 3 2\n1 3\n2 \n1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3\n4\n", "TESTCASE_2": "5 4\n1 2 3 2 1\n1 2 \n1 3\n2 \n1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3\n3\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
