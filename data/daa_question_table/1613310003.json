{"Q_ID": "1613310003", "S_NAME": "Divide and Conquer", "Q_NAME": "Closest Pair of Points", "Q_DESC": "Closest Pair of Points\nGetting the minimum distance among the given set of points usually requires O(n^2). But by using divide/conquer algorithm with some tricks, we can achieve O(n log n) complexity.                   We split the points, and get the minimum distances from left and right side of the split. If we are lucky, we can get the closest pair from one of the two sides. However, if we are unlucky, the closest pair of points are from both sides. In other words, one from left, and one from right side. In this case, we compare the points which are within the strip of width 2d.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n10 20\n5 1 \n2 10\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe smallest distance is 3.605551", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n2 3\n12 30\n40 50\n5 1 \n12 10\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe smallest distance is 1.414214", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
