You are required to find the top left and bottom right co-ordinates of the smallest square sub-matrix of A such that the sum of all the elements in the square sub-matrix is K\n\nA sub-matrix of the original matrix having co-ordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) is considered to be a square sub-matrix if |x1x2|=0 and \nx2x1 = y2y1.\n\nAll elements (i,j), where x1ix2, and y1jy2 are considered to be a part of the square (x1,y1), (x2,y2)\n\nInput\n\nFirst line comprises two space-separated integers N and K\nEach of the next N lines contains N space separated integers. where the jth integer on the ith line denotes A[i][j].\n\nOutput :\n\nIf there exists a matrix satisfying the above conditions, then on the first line print YES (without quotes). On the next line, Print four space-separated integers x1, y1, x2, and y2, which denote the top left and bottom right positions of the smallest square sub-matrix of A such that the sum of all the elements in the square sub-matrix is  to K. If there are multiple answers, print any one answer.\n\nIf there is no such square sub-matrix, then print NO without quotes.\n\nConstraints\n\n1N250\n0A[i][j]10^9\n1K10^15", "TESTCASE_1": "3 12\n11 1 0\n1 11 0\n0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\n1 1 2 2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 99\n1 1 1\n0 0 0 \n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
