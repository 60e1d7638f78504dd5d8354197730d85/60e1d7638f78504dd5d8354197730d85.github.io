Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson, suggests Moriarty may be responsible for MI6's recent issues with their supercomputer, The Beast.\n\nShortly after resolving to investigate, Sherlock receives a note from Moriarty boasting about infecting The Beast with a virus; however, he also gives him a clue a number, N. Sherlock determines the key to removing the virus is to find the largest Decent Number having N digits.\n\nA Decent Number has the following properties:\n\n   1. Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.\n    2. The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.\n    3. The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.\n    4. If there are more than one such number, we pick the largest one.                              \n Constraints:\n1 = T = 20\n 1 =N = 100000                   \n   \n Input Format:\n\nThe first line is an integer, T , denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, detailing the number of digits in the number.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the largest Decent Number having N digits; if no such number exists, tell Sherlock by printing -1.    \n\nMoriarty's virus shows a clock counting down to The Beast's destruction, and time is running out fast. Your task is to help Sherlock find the key before The Beast is destroyed!", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n1\n3\n5\n11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n555\n33333\n55555533333", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n5\n7\n11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n33333\n-1\n55555533333", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n5\n5\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n\n33333\n33333\n33333", "TESTCASE_4": "5\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n555\n555555\n555555555\n555555555555\n555555555555555", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
