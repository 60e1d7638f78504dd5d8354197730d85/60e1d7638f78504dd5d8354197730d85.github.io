{"Q_ID": "1614110007", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "JIM AND THE ORDERS", "Q_DESC": "Jim's Burgers has n hungry burger fans waiting in line. Each unique order, i,is placed by a customer at time ti, and the order takes di units of time to process.\n\nGiven the information for all n orders, can you find and print the order in which all n customers will receive their burgers? If two or more orders are fulfilled at the exact same time  t, sort them by ascending order number.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of orders.\nEach of the n subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of ti and di for order i.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= n<= 10^3\n1 <= i<= n\n1 <= ti, di  <=10^6\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single line of n space-separated order numbers (recall that orders are numbered from 1 to n ) describing the sequence in which the customers receive their burgers. If two or more customers receive their burgers at the same time, print the smallest order number first.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 3\n2 3\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 3", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n8 1\n4 2\n5 6\n3 1\n4 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4 2 5 1 3", "TESTCASE_3": "4 \n1 4 \n2 3\n4 5\n2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n 4 1 2 3 ", "TESTCASE_4": "2 \n1 4 \n2 3\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
