{"Q_ID": "1614110012", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "LUCKY BALANCE", "Q_DESC": "Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded by N sequential preliminary contests. She believes in saving luck, and wants to check her theory. Each contest is described by two integers, Li  and Ti :\n\n1. Li is the amount of luck that can be gained by winning the contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by Li; if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by Li.\n 2. Ti denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to 1 if the contest is important, and it's equal to 0 if it's unimportant.\nIf Lena loses no more than K  important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, N (the number of preliminary contests) and K (the maximum number of important contests Lena can lose), respectively. \n\nEach line i of the N subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers, Li (the contest's luck balance) and Ti (the contest's importance rating), respectively.\n\nConstraints\n1=N=100                                \n 0=K=N                                         \n1=Li=10^4                                   \n0=Ti=1\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single integer denoting the maximum amount of luck Lena can have after all the contests.", "TESTCASE_1": "6 3\n5 1\n2 1\n1 1\n8 1\n10 0\n5 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_2": "2 1\n1 1\n8 1\n10 0\n5 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_3": "5 3\n5 1\n4 6\n1 1\n3 2\n10 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n23", "TESTCASE_4": "2 1\n1 1\n6 1\n10 10\n5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n\n5", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
