{"Q_ID": "1614110016", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "ADD-SUBTRACT", "Q_DESC": "Chandan is back with his array to blow your mind. As usual Chandan has an array consisting of N integers .He allows you to perform 2 kinds of operation on his array.\n\nType 1 : Increment any integer of the array by 1.\n\nType 2 : Decrement any integer of the array by 1.\n\nYou can perform these operation as many times as you want on his array.\n\nEach operation of Type 1 costs 3 while each operation of Type 2 costs 5.\n\nNow Chandan wants to have K equal elements in his array.So he asks you to tell him the minimum cost required in obtaining K equal elements in his array.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains T indicating test cases.Second line contains 2 integers N indicating the number of elements in his array and K.\n\nThird line contains N space separated integers denoting Chandan array.\n\nOutput:\n\nThe minimum cost required to get K equal elements.\n\nConstraints :\n\n1  = T = 100\n\n1 = K = N =100\n\n1 = A[i] =100", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n5 3\n9 4 9 7 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5 5\n9 4 9 7 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n42", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n5 3\n6 7 9 8 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n\n8", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n5 5\n9 4 5 7 8 4 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
