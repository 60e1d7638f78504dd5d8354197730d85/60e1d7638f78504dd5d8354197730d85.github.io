On acquiring gems player can get three gems of distinct colors or two gems of the same color from the table.\n\nEdward is planning to buy an artifact, it costs r red gems, g green gems and b blue gems. Compute, what is the minimum number of turns Edward has to make to earn at least r red gems, \ng green gems and b blue gems, so that he will be able to buy the artifact.\n\nInput format\n\nInput contains three integers in a single line r, g and b  the number of red, green and blue gems, respectively, required to buy the artifact.\n\nConstraints\n\n0 = r,g,b =10^18\n\nOutput format\n\nOutput single integer: the minimum number of turns Edward has to make to be able to buy the artifact.", "TESTCASE_1": "4 5 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "57 54 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n79", "TESTCASE_3": "25 4 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16", "TESTCASE_4": "75 54 23 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n65", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
