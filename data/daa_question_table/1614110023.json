{"Q_ID": "1614110023", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "JUMPING CHAMPA", "Q_DESC": "Champa loved traveling the world. He loved going from one city to the other. Being the miser that he is, he never wishes spend any money. Champa, instead, jumps from one city to the other. Also he likes trips of high quality.\n\nHe can start at any city of his choice. Given that he has visited the ith city, he will not visit it again, he will only visit the remaining unvisited cities.  This means that Champa will jump n - 1 times in total, so that he can visit all of the n cities.\n\nGiven two cities at heights, A and B, the amount of money spent is Q * |A - B| where Q is the quality of a trip. Champa has a list of cities he's dying to visit. Can you tell the minimum amount of money Champa would have to spend to visit all of the cities?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case is described by two lines.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains N describing the number of cities that Champa wishes to visit, followed by Q, which is the quality of the whole trip.\n\nThe following line contains N space separated integers Hi which describes the height of the ith city.\n\nOutput\nT lines each containing a single integer such that the answer to the ith line contains the answer to the ith test case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 = T, Q, N = 10^3\n1 =  Hi = 3 * 10^6", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 4\n2 1\n1 5\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n1 5\n3 \n2 4\n2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 4\n3 1\n1 6\n4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n1 5\n5\n2 3\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n\n0\n3", "TESTCASE_5": "\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n"}
