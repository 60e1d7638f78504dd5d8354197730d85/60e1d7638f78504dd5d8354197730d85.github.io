{"Q_ID": "1614110030", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "Kevin doesn't like his array", "Q_DESC": "Kevin has an array A of N integers, but he doesn't like it - he only likes an array if all its neighboring elements are different (e.g. he likes the array [2,4,2,5,3,2,4], but not [1,2,3,3,4]).\n\nKevin can reverse any contiguous subarray of his array any number of times. For example, if he has the array [2,4,2,5,3,2,4] and reverses the subarray from 2nd to 5th element, he will obtain the array [2,3,5,2,4,2,4].\n\nNow, Kevin wants to know the minimum number of reversals necessary to transform his array into an array he likes - if it's possible.\n\nInput format:\n\nThe first line of the input will contain an integer N. The second line will contain N space-separated integers - the elements of A.\n\nOutput format:\n\nIf it's impossible to transform Kevin's array into an array he likes, print -1 (without the quotes). Otherwise, print one number - the minimum number of reversals necessary.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 = N = 10^5\n1 = Ai = 10^5\nN = 5 in test data worth 15% of all points\nN = 10^3 in test data worth 40% of all points", "TESTCASE_1": "7\n1 3 2 2 4 4 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n42343 42343 99122 7722 7722\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n1 3 2 2 4 4 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "5\n4 4 9 2 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
