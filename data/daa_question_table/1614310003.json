{"Q_ID": "1614310003", "S_NAME": "Greedy Algorithm", "Q_NAME": "CHIEF HOPPER", "Q_DESC": "Chief's bot is playing an old DOS-based game. There are N+1 buildings in the game  indexed from 0 to N and are placed left-to-right. It is guaranteed that building with index 0will be of height 0 unit. For buildings with index i (i[1,N]) height will be hi units. \n\nAt beginning Chief's bot is at building with index 0. At each step, bot jumps to next (right) building. Suppose bot is at kth building and his current energy is botEnergy, then in next step he will jump to (k+1)th building. He will gain/lose energy equal in amount to difference between hk+1 and botEnergy\n\nIf hk+1>botEnergy, then he will lose hk+1botEnergy units of energy.\nOtherwise, he will gain botEnergyhk+1 units of energy.\nGoal is to reach Nth building, and during the course bot should never have negative energy units. What should be the minimum units of energy with which bot should start to successfully complete the game?\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains integer N. Next line contains N space separated integers h1,h2,...,hN representing the heights of the buildings.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single number representing minimum units of energy required to complete the game.\n\nConstraints \n1N10^5 \n1hi10^5,i[1,N]", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n4 4 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n3 4 3 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
