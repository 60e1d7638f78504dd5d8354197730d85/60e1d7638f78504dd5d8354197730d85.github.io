He has N packets of candies and would like to distribute one packet to each of the K children in the village (each packet may contain different number of candies). \n\nTo avoid any fighting among the children, he would like to pick K out of N packets, such that unfairness is minimized.\n\nSuppose the K packets have (x1, x2, x3,....xk) candies in them, where xi denotes the number of candies in the ith packet, then we define unfairness as max(x1,x2,...xk) - min(x1,x2,...xk) \n\nwhere max denotes the highest value amongst  the elements, and min denotes the least value amongst the elements. \n\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer N.\nThe second line contains an integer K. N lines follow. \nEach line contains an integer that denotes the candy in the ith packet.\n\nOutput Format\nAn integer that denotes the minimum possible value of unfairness.           \n\nConstraints :\n2<=N<=10^5 \n2<=K<=N \n0<= number of candies in each packet <=10^9", "TESTCASE_1": "7\n3\n10 100 300 200 1000 20 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20", "TESTCASE_2": "10\n4\n1 2 3 4 10 20 30 40 100 200\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "8\n4\n1 4 2 3 5 10 3 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "10\n4\n1 2 3 100 12 8 7 9 11 200\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
