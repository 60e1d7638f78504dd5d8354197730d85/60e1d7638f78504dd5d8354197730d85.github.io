In this game, you can alternatively remove 1, 2 or 3 bricks from the top, and the numbers etched on the removed bricks are added to your score. \n\nYou have to play so that you obtain the maximum possible score. It is given that your friend will also play optimally and you make the first move.\n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain an integer T i.e. number of test cases. There will be two lines corresponding to each test case: first line will contain a number N i.e. number of elements in the stack and next line will contain N numbers i.e. numbers etched on bricks from top to bottom.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 5 \n1 <= N <= 10^5 \n0 <= each number on brick <= 10^9\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing your maximum score.\n\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5\n999 1 1 1 0\n5\n0 1 1 1 999\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1001\n999", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5\n999 0 1 1 1\n5\n1 1 1 0 999\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1000\n1000", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n5\n999  1 1 1 0\n5\n1 1 1 0 999\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1001\n1000", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n5\n999  0 1 1 0\n5\n0 1 1 1  999\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1000\n999", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
