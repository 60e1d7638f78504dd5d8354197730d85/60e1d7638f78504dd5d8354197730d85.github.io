{"Q_ID": "1615110011", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "THE LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE", "Q_DESC": "A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. \n\nGiven two sequence of integers, A=[a1,a2,...,an] and B=[b1,b2,...,bn],  find any one longest common subsequence.\n\nIn case multiple solutions exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one non-empty common subsequence will exist.           \n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where  n is the size of sequence A, while  m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B.                          \n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the longest common subsequence and each element should be separated by at least one white-space. In case of multiple answers, print any one of them.                       \n", "TESTCASE_1": "5 6\n1 2 3 4 1\n3 4 1 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 3", "TESTCASE_2": "6 7\n1 2 3 4 1 2\n3 4 1 2 1 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 4 1 2", "TESTCASE_3": "6 6\n1 2 3 4 1 3\n3 4 1 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 4 1 3", "TESTCASE_4": "4 3\n3 4 1 3\n4 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4 1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
