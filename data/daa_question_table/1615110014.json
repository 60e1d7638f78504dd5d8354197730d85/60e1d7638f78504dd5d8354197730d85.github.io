As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. \n\nShe asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e 2,4,6,8 ) for every index \n(1=i=|S|). For an index  i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains a string S.\n\nOutput:\nPrint |S| space-separated integers,the result of every index.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=  |S| = 10^4", "TESTCASE_1": "574674546\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5 5 5 4 3 3 2 2 1", "TESTCASE_2": "54566987543\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5 5 4 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 0", "TESTCASE_3": "4645557\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 2 1 0 0 0 0", "TESTCASE_4": "9834577655\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
