{"Q_ID": "1615110016", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "RHEZO & PRIME PROBLEMS", "Q_DESC": "Rhezo and his friend Vanya love problem solving. They have a problem set containing N problems, with points assigned to each. Rhezo wants to solve problems in such a way that he gets the maximum number of points. \n\nRhezo has a weird habit of solving only prime number of consecutive problems, that is, if he solves  X consecutive problems from the problem set, then  X should be prime. \n\nVanya has already solved all problems from the problem set and he wonders how much maximum points Rhezo can get. Vanya can answer this, but can you?\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of problems in the problem set. Next line contains  N space separated integers denoting the points assigned to the problems.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint a single integer, the maximum points Rhezo can get.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1<= N<=5000\n1<= Points of Problems <=10^5\n\nHints:  For example \nSample Input:\n4\n8 1 3 7\n\nSample Output:\n12\n\nRhezo will solve problems 1, 2 and 3, and will get  12  points. Note that, he cannot solve all the problems because then he will solve \n4 (non-prime) consecutive problems.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n8 1 3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "7\n5 6 3 8 9 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n34", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n10 8 1 3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_4": "3\n10 3 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n21", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
