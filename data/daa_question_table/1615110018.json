Panda is doing an extensive research on prime numbers. Milinda has got a question for Panda. The only way for Panda to impress Milinda is by solving this question.\n\nGiven a number N, find the minimum number of primatic numbers which sum upto N.\n\nA primatic number refers to a number which is either a prime number or can be expressed as power of prime number to itself i.e. prime^prime e.g. 4, 27, etc.\n\nNote: 8, 32, etc are not primatic numbers.\nPanda is very sad since he is unable to solve the problem. Please help Panda in solving this problem.                        \n\nInput Format:\nThe first line will contain two integers: T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single integer N.\n\nOutput Format:\nFor each query output the minimum number of primatic numbers which can sum upto N.\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= T <= 10^5\n2 <= N <= 10^4\n\nSubtask 1:\nT = 100, 2 <= N <= 1000 - 20 points\n\nSubtask 2:\nT = 10^5, 2 <= N <= 104 - 80 points", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n6 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "11\n4 2 1 3 5 7 6 9 8 10 21\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n2 3 4 5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n2 1 5 3 7 9 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
