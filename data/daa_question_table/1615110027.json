Hackerearth welcomes you all and hope that all you awesome coders have a great time. So without wasting much of the time let's begin the contest.\n\nPrime Numbers have always been one of the favourite topics for problem setters. \n\nAishwarya is a mathematics student at the Department of Mathematics and Computing, California. Her teacher recently gave her an intriguing assignment with only a single question. The question was to find out the minimum number of single digit prime numbers which when summed equals a given number X.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer X.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the minimum number required. If it is not possible to obtain X using single digit prime numbers, output -1.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=100\n1<=X<=10^6", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n7\n10\n14\n11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n5688\n11126\n17529\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n814\n1590\n2505", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n3\n67\n21\n34\n76\n23\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n11\n3\n6\n12\n4", "TESTCASE_4": "4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
