Now, Jhool is learning Mathematics from Jaadu; he wants to know about the Mathematics of the other planet, too.\n\nIn Jaadu's planet, the sequence of powers of two are called the: The JP. (Jaadu power!) That is,  2^1,2^2,2^3....2^1000000.  10,00,000 being the limit known to the people on Jaadu's planet. Also, Jhool is smart so he notices that this particular sequence starts from index 1 and NOT 0. Now since Jhool thinks that he's understood the sequence well, already so he challenges Jaadu.\n\nJaadu gives him a number, denoted by N, and asks Jhool to find the number of pairs  (i,j) such that (JP[i]-1) divides  (JP[j]-1) and 1<=i<j<=N. Jhool is stunned by this difficult question. And needs your help!\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains number of test cases T. Each test cases contains single integer N.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print total numbers of pairs (i,j) such that 1<= i<j<=N and  JP[i]-1 is divisors of JP[j]-1.\n\nConstraints: \n\n1<=T<=10000 \n 1<=N<=1000000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "20\n100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n382\n383\n390\n391\n398\n405\n408\n409\n420\n421\n428\n431\n440\n441\n448\n451\n456\n461\n464\n467", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n2\n4\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "19\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n4\n5\n8\n9\n12\n14\n17\n23\n24\n27\n30\n34\n35\n40\n46\n49\n52", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
