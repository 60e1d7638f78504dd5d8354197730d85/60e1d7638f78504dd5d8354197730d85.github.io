He knows how to draw some angles. He also can add/subtract any of the two angles he draws. Rani now wants to test Raju.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains N and K, denoting number of angles Raju knows how to draw and \nK the number of angles Rani will tell Raju to draw. \nNext line contains, N space separated integers denoting the angles which Raju knows how to draw. Next line contains K space separated numbers denoting the angles Rani wants Raju to draw.\n\nOutput:\nFor each of the K angles Rani wants Raju to draw, output YES or NO (quotes for clarity) if he can draw those angles or not respectively.\n\nConstraints: \n\n1N,K10 \n 0Allangles360", "TESTCASE_1": "1 2\n100\n60 70\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "4 5\n120 304 184 200\n331 352 251 208 332\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
