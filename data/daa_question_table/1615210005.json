He wanted to meet the God of Numbers, Numz! Hence, he started solving numerical problems, day in and day out without any break. After many days of continuous effort, Numz was delighted with Puchi's dedication and invited him over for tea. At tea, Puchi exclaimed that humans have now become proficient in numbers and could surpass Numz with their knowledge and ability. Numz, being the God of Numbers got infuriated and challenged Puchi for a numerical Armageddon!, of what could go on to establish the numerical superiority of Gods over Humans. \n\nThe first round of Armageddon begins. Numz locks Puchi in a cage and gives him a string S, consisting of only numerical digits [0-9] , and declares:\n\nI shall release a hungry lion in this cage. You shall not fight with the lion, but only satisfy its hunger. The lion eats every minute a number that does not leave a remainder when divided by 6. You can use a subsequence of the string S to form a number and feed it to the lion. Beware! You can use each subsequence only once. Good Luck Mortal!\nGiven the string S, can you tell how many minutes will Puchi survive? \n\nINPUT\nFirst line contains an integer T. T test cases follow. \nEach test case contains a string S of numerical digits [0-9] . \n\nOUTPUT\nPrint the answer to each test case modulo 10^9 + 7 in a new line.\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1  T  10\n1  |S|  10^6\nS contains only numerical digits [0-9]", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n1232\n1023\n23\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n3\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "10\n6\n521\n52\n330\n1\n4\n676\n91\n318\n95\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n0\n4\n0\n0\n3\n0\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
