{"Q_ID": "1615210008", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "Vibhu and Mathematics", "Q_DESC": "In code world all genders are considered equal ( It means their is nothing like male or female). Now their are N distinct persons living in this hypothetical world. Each person can pair up with any other person or can even remain single. \nOne day Vbhu planned to visit code world. Being a maths guy , he always try to be mathematical. So he started counting the ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or remain single. A single person can make pair with at most one other person.\nSeeing that N can be large , Vibhu ask you for help. Now being a great programmer you need to help Vbhu count the number of ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or remain single.\n\nNote : Its not necessary that everyone is required to make pair with someone. Person can remain single also.\n\nInput Format : \nFirst line contain number of test cases T. Then next T lines contain a single integer N , denoting the number of persons living in code world.\n\nOutput Format : \nYou need to print the number of ways in which N different persons can make their pairs or stay single. As answer can be large so print it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nConstraints :\n1 <= T <=10^5 \n1 <= N <=10^6\n\nWarning: Large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n4\n", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n4 \n3\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n4\n2\n", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
