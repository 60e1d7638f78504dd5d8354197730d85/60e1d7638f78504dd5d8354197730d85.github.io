{"Q_ID": "1615310001", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "Parade", "Q_DESC": "A school has N students, numbered from 1 to N. Each student wears a T shirt of some color. The T shirt of the ith student is of color** Ci**.\nThe teachers of the school want to organize a parade. In the parade, there will be some students standing in a straight line in increasing order of height.\nThe number of students in the line should be atmost M and atleast 1. Your job is to calculate the number of distinct parades that can be organised.\n\nTwo parades are said to be distinct if the sequence made by colors of T-shirts worn by students are different.\n\nFor each student i, you are given one student Li such that height(Li) < height (i).\nLi for the shortest student will be 0. The height of all students are distinct.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases, T.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, N and M.\nN lines follow. The ith line contains two space separated integers, Li and Ci.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer of that test case.\nOutput the answer modulo (10^9+7)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1<=T<=50\n\n1<=M<=N<=10^3\n\n0<=Li<=N\nAll Li are distinct\n\n1<=Ci<=1000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2 1\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n0 1\n1 2\n2 2\n0 1\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n2 1\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n0 1\n1 2\n1 1\n0 5\n1 1\n0 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
