{"Q_ID": "1615310001", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "Parade", "Q_DESC": "A school has N students, numbered from 1 to N. Each student wears a T shirt of some color. The T shirt of the ith student is of color** Ci**.\nThe teachers of the school want to organize a parade. In the parade, there will be some students standing in a straight line in increasing order of height.\nThe number of students in the line should be atmost M and atleast 1. Your job is to calculate the number of distinct parades that can be organised.\n\nTwo parades are said to be distinct if the sequence made by colors of T-shirts worn by students are different.\n\nFor each student i, you are given one student Li such that height(Li)  height (i).\nLi for the shortest student will be 0. The height of all students are distinct.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases, T.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, N and M.\nN lines follow. The ith line contains two space separated integers, Li and Ci.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer of that test case.\nOutput the answer modulo (10^9+7)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=T=50\n\n1=M=N=10^3\n\n0=Li=N\nAll Li are distinct\n\n1=Ci=1000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2 1\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n0 1\n1 2\n2 2\n0 1\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n2 1\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n0 1\n1 2\n1 1\n0 5\n1 1\n0 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
