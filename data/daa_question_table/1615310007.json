{"Q_ID": "1615310007", "S_NAME": "Dynamic Programming", "Q_NAME": "Alien Languages", "Q_DESC": "Sophia has discovered several alien languages. Suprisingly, all of these languages have an alphabet, and each of them may contain thousands of characters! Also, all the words in a language have the same number of characters in it.\n\nHowever, the aliens like their words to be aesthetically pleasing, which for them means that for the ith letter of an n letter alphabet (letters are indexed at 1):\n\nif 2 * i  n\n\nthe ith letter may be the last letter of a word, and it may be immediately followed by any letter including itself.\n\nif 2 * i  n\n\nthe ith letter can not be the last letter of a word and also can only be immediately followed by jth letter iff(if and only if) j  2 * i.\n\nSophia wants to know how many different words exist in this language. Since the result may be large, she wants to know this number, modulo 100000007.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases. The first line is followed by t lines, each line denoting a test case. Each test case will have two space separated integers n,*m* which denote the number of letters in the language and the length of words in this language respectively.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  t  5\n1  n  10^5\n1  m  5*10^5\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each testcase output the number of possible words modulo 100000007.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 3\n2 3\n3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n3\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 5\n4 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n3\n120\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
