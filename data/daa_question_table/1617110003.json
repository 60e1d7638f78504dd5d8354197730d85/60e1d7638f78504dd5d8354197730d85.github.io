{"Q_ID": "1617110003", "S_NAME": "Graph Colouring", "Q_NAME": "Monk Learning Graph", "Q_DESC": "Monk once went to the graph city to learn graphs, and meets an undirected graph having N nodes, where each node have value val[i] where 1=i=N. Each node of the graph is very curious and wants to know something about the nodes which are directly connected to the current node.\n\nFor each node, if we sort the nodes (according to their values), which are directly connected to it, in descending order (in case of equal values, sort it according to their indices in ascending order), then what will be the number of the node at kth position, if positions are given starting from 1.\n\nNote: If the values are same , then sort it  . Now Graph gave this task to Monk. Help Monk for the same.\n\nInput Format :\n\nThe first line will consist of 3 space separated integers N,M, k denoting the number of nodes, number of edges and value of k respectively.  \n\nIn next line, there will be N space separated integers, val[i] , where 1= i= N, denoting the value of ith node.\n\nIn next M lines, each line contains 2 integers X and Y, representing an edge between X and Y.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint N lines, where ith line contains the required node for the ith node. If there is no such node, print  -1.\n\nConstraints: :\n\n1 =N =10^3\n1 =M =10^6\n1= k= M\n1 =val[i] =10^4\n1= X,Y= N", "TESTCASE_1": "3 3 2\n2 4 3\n1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "3 3 2\n2 3 3\n1 3\n1 2\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3 3 2\n2 3 3 \n1 3\n2 2\n1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "3 3 2\n3 2 2\n1 2\n1 2 \n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n-1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
