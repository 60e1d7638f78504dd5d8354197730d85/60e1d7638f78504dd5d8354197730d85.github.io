Master parent is the vertex which has no parent but may have 0 or more children. \n\nIn any connected component of the graph,vertex with the lowest value in that component serves as the master parent. \n\nA vertex is called happy if it has more children than its parent. Count the number of happy vertices in the given graph.The graph has no cycles or self loops.\n\nInput Format:\n\nFirst line consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M and the following M lines consist of two space separated integers X and Y denoting there is an edge between vertices X and Y.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nPrint the number of happy vertices in the graph.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=N<=100000\n0<=M<=N -1 \n 1<=X,Y<=N", "TESTCASE_1": "4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "7 6\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n4 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "7 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
