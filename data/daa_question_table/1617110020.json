However, Big P cannot dance with all of them, because there are many of them.\n\nNow if a girl gets to dance with Big P, she considers herself to be \" 1-Lucky \". A person that dances with someone who has danced with a person who has danced with Big P considers themselves \" 2-Lucky \", and so on.\n\nThe Luckiness is defined on the basis of above mentioned rule. ( 1-Lucky -> Luckiness = 1).\n\nNote1: Luckiness of Big P is 0 .\n\nNote2: No one has negative luckiness.\n\nNote3: If a person's luckiness cannot be determined from the above rules (he/she has not danced with anyone with finite luckiness), his/her luckiness is INF (infinity).\n\nNote4: If a person A is not Big P himself, and has danced with someone with luckiness X, and has not danced with anyone with Luckiness smaller than X, then A has luckiness X+1 .\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line has two numbers A, number of persons in the party and B, number of dancing couples Then B lines follow, each containing two distinct persons, denoting that the two persons have danced. \nPersons are represented by numbers between 0 and A-1.\n\nBig P is represented by 0.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOutput A-1 lines , ith line containing the luckiness of ith person. (1<= i <= A-1)\nIf luckiness cannot be calculated for a person - print \"-1\"(without the quotes).\n\n[A<=1000 , B <=(A*(A-1))/2 ]", "TESTCASE_1": "5 6\n0 1\n0 2\n3 2\n2 4\n4 3\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "6 6\n0 1\n0 2\n0 3\n3 2\n2 4\n4 3\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n1\n2\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "4 6\n1 2\n3 4\n1 3\n2 0\n1 3\n0 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "5 4\n4 6\n2 0\n3 2\n1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n2\n-1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
