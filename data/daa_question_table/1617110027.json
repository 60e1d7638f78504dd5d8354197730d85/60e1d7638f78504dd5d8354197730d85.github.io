{"Q_ID": "1617110027", "S_NAME": "Graph Colouring", "Q_NAME": "Jack goes to Rapture", "Q_DESC": "Jack has just moved to a new city called Rapture. However, he is confused by Rapture's public transport system. The rules of the public transport are as follows:\n\nEvery pair of connected stations has a fare assigned to it.\n\nIf a passenger travels from station A to station B, he only has to pay the difference between the fare from A to B and the cumulative fare that he has paid to reach station A [fare(A,B) - total fare to reach station A]. If the difference is negative, he can travel free of cost from A to B.\n\nSince Jack is new to the city, he is unemployed and low on cash. He needs your help to figure out the most cost efficient way to go from the first station to the last station. You are given the number of stations N, and the fare between the E pair of stations that are connected.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains two integers, N and E, followed by E lines containing three integers each: the two stations that are connected to each other and the fare between them (C).\n\nConstraints\n\n1=N=50000                            \n1=E=500000                            \n1=C=10^7\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe minimum fare to be paid to reach station N from station 1. If the station N cannot be reached from station 1, print NO PATH EXISTS (without quotes).", "TESTCASE_1": "5 5\n1 2 60\n3 5 70 \n1 4 120\n4 5 150\n2 3 80\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n80", "TESTCASE_2": "4 4\n1 2 60\n2 3 10\n1 4 20\n3 4 30\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20", "TESTCASE_3": "5 5\n2 4 50\n1 2 40\n4 1 60\n4 5 120\n4 2 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n120", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
