In order to lose weight, he has to run on boundary of gardens.\nBut he lives in a country where there are no gardens. There are just many bidirectional roads between cities.\nDue to the situation, he is going to consider any cycle of length four as a garden. Formally a garden is considered to be a unordered set of 4 roads {r0, r1, r2, r3} where ri and ri+1 mod 4 share a city.\n\nNow he wonders how many distinct gardens are there in this country.\n\nInput format:\n\nThe first integer contains N, the number of cities in the country.  It is followed by space separated elements of N*N binary matrix G.\nG[i][j] = 1 denotes there is a road between ith city and jth city.  A pair of cities has atmost one road connecting them. No road connects a city to itself.\nG is symmetric.\n\nOutput format:\nPrint the total number of gardens.", "TESTCASE_1": "8\n0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 \n1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 \n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 \n1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \n0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 \n0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 \n0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 \n0 1 0 1 \n1 0 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 \n0 1 1 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "6\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
