Here is one more from our own Monk:\nGiven an undirected graph with \nN vertices anM edges, what is the maximum number of edges in any connected component of the graph.\nIn other words, if given graph has \nk connected components, and \n\nE1,E2,....Ek be the number of edges in the respective connected component, then find\nmax(E1,E2,....,Ek) .\n\nThe graph may have multiple edges and self loops. The N vertices are numbered as \n1,2,...,N.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line of input consists of two space separated integers \nN and M, denoting number of vertices in the graph and number of edges in the graph respectively.\nFollowing M lines consists of two space separated each a and b, denoting there is an edge between vertex a and vertex b.\n\nOutput Format:\nThe only line of output consists of answer of the question asked by Monk.\n\nInput Constraints:\n\n1N10^5\n0M10^5\n1a,bN", "TESTCASE_1": "6 3\n1 2\n2 3\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "5 4\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
