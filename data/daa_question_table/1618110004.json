{"Q_ID": "1618110004", "S_NAME": "String Matching", "Q_NAME": "Matching Strings", "Q_DESC": "PIET's CS Department is writing a spell-checker system, and you have been tasked with writing a function to determine how closely two words resemble each other. The algorithm you are to use, albeit not a very good one, is to compare the two words character by character, and count how many times the characters in a given position are the same.\n\nFor instance, the words \"TICK\" and \"TOCK\" have a score of 3, since three characters (T, C, K) are the same.\n\nSimilarly, \"CAT\" and \"DOG\" score 0, since no letters match.\n\nYou are given Strings A and B and you have to return an integer K indicating the score (as defined above) of how closely the two match.\n\nInput :\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input, where first line contains the string A and second line contains the string B.\n\nOutput :\n\nFor each test case print the score on a line.\n\nConstraints :\n\nA and B will each contain between 1 and 500 characters, inclusive.\nEach character of a and b will be 'A'-'Z'.\n1 <= T <= 50", "TESTCASE_1": "3\nTICK\nTOCK\nCAT\nDOG\nAPPLE\nAPPLES  \nFANTASTIC\nANTASTIC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n0\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "4\nTICK\nTOCK\nCAT\nDOG\nAPPLE\nAPPLES  \nFANTASTIC\nANTASTIC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n0\n5\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "6\nTICK\nTOCK\nCAT\nDOG\nAPPLE\nAPPLES \nFANTASTIC\nANTASTIC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n0\n5\n0\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "5\nTICK\nTICK\nCAT\nDOG\nAPPLES\nAPPLES \nANTASTIC\nFANTASTIC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n6\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
