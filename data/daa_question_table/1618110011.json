They are finding the overlap in the pattern and finding pattern in target string.\nHow to find the overlap in the given pattern?\n\nHere, we need to find suffix(in the pattern) that matches prefix of the given pattern.  For example, abcdabd is the input string.  ab at the end is the suffix that matches the prefix ab at the start  = abcdabd", "TESTCASE_1": "C is a Programming Language\nis a\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nis a located at the index 3", "TESTCASE_2": "THIS IS A TEST TEXT\nTEST\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTEST located at the index 11", "TESTCASE_3": "EXCELPROGRAM\nPRO\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nPRO located at the index 6", "TESTCASE_4": "ELABPROGRAMMING\nMM\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMM located at the index 11", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
