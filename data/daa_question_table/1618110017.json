So, his friend advised him to type the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)\n\nAfter typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.\n\nGiven a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.\n\nInput Format\n\nInput consists of a string s.\n\nConstraints \nLength of s can be at most 10^3(1<=|s|<=10^3)  and it may contain spaces, lower case and upper case letters. Lower-case and upper-case instances of a letter are considered the same.\n\nOutput Format\n\nOutput a line containing pangram if s is a pangram, otherwise output not pangram.", "TESTCASE_1": "We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\npangram", "TESTCASE_2": "We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the prize\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nnot pangram", "TESTCASE_3": "welcome to data structure lab\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nnot pangram", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
