The assignment is to write a program for string matching. \n\nShe was asked to write a function match(char[],char[]) which return an integer. This integer has to be -1 if the match doesn't occur and the location if the string is present.                                           \n\nFor example the string \"Paris\" is present in \"Welcome to Paris\". If the string is present then it's location (i.e. at which position it is present) is printed. We are implementing naive string search algorithm in our program.", "TESTCASE_1": "THIS IS A TEST TEXT\nTEST\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFound at location 11", "TESTCASE_2": "C is a Programming Language\nis a\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFound at location 3", "TESTCASE_3": "this is a algorithmic paper\npa\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFound at location 23", "TESTCASE_4": "language skill\nil\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFound at location 12", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
