Each rock is composed of various elements, and each element is represented by a lower-case Latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. \n\nAn element is called a gem-element if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.\n\nGiven the list of N rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line consists of an integer, N, the number of rocks. \nEach of the next N lines contains a rock's composition. Each composition consists of lower-case letters of English alphabet.\n\nConstraints \n 1<=N<=100\nEach composition consists of only lower-case Latin letters ('a'-'z'). \n 1<=length of each composition<=100 \n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the number of gem-elements that are common in these rocks.
