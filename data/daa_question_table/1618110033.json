Note that we will not consider ABCD as a common child because C doesn't occur before D in the second string.\n\nInput format\n\nTwo strings,  a and b , with a newline separating them.\n\nConstraints\n\n1= |a|,|b| = 5000\n\nAll characters are upper cased and lie between ASCII values 65-90.\n\nOutput format\n\nPrint the length of the longest string s , such that s is a child of both a and b.", "TESTCASE_1": "HARRY\nSALLY\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "AA\nBB\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "SHINCHAN\nNOHARAAA\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "ABCDEF\nFBDAMN\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
