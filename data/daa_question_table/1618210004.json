For example ,if \ni=2,\nj=1,\nk=3, it represents the string \naabccc. In short, a good subsequence is a subsequence that first consist of i acharacters, followed by j \nb' characters, followed by \nk c characters, where i1, \nj1 and k1\n\nNow, you need to find the number of good subsequences of String S. As the number of such subsequences could be rather large, print the answer Modulo \n10^9+7.\n\nNote1: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first and only line of input contains the S\nOutput Format :\n\nPrint the required answer on a single line.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1|S|10^5", "TESTCASE_1": "abcabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "cacaabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
