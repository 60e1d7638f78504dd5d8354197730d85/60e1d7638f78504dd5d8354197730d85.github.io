{"Q_ID": "1618210006", "S_NAME": "String Matching", "Q_NAME": "Count Of Substrings", "Q_DESC": "Ria has excellent skills in programming.To boost her intelligence,her class teacher gave her a problem to Count the no:of substrings.\n\nProblem :\nHer Class teacher gave her n strings numbered from 1 to n which consists of only lowercase letters (each having length not more than 10) and then ask Q questions related to the given strings.\n\nEach question is described by the 2 integers L,R and a string str,Now her teacher wants to know how many strings numbered from L to R contains str as a substrings.\n\nAs expected, Ria solved this problem. What might be her code?\n\nINPUT\nFirst line of input contains a single integer n denoting the number of strings given by class teacher to jack.Next n lines of input contains n strings (one per line).Next line fo input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of questions asked by his teacher.next Q lines of input contains Q question (one per line) as explained above.\n\nOUTPUT\nprint the correct answer for each of the question asked by his teacher.\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n1<=n<=10000\n1<=strlen(str)<=10\n1<=Q<=5*10^5\n1<=L,R<=n\n\nNOTE: strings consist of only lower case characters", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nSrm\nSrmUniv\n2\n1 3 Srm\n1 3 SrmU\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "3\ncode\ncoder\ncoding\n2\n1 3 code\n1 3 co\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
