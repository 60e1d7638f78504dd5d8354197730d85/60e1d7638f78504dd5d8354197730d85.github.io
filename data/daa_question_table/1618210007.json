Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences.\n\nGiven two sequence of integers, A=[a1,a2,,an] and B=[b1,b2,,bm], find any one longest common subsequence.\n\nIn case multiple solutions exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one non-empty common subsequence will exist.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where n is the size of sequence A, while m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B.\n\nn m\nA1 A2  An\nB1 B2  Bm\n\nConstraints\n\n1n100\n1m100\n0ai<1000,where i[1,n]\n0bj<1000,where j[1,m]\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the longest common subsequence and each element should be separated by at least one white-space.
