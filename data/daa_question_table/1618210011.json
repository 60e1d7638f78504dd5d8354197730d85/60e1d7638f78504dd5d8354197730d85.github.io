{"Q_ID": "1618210011", "S_NAME": "String Matching", "Q_NAME": "Build a Palindrome", "Q_DESC": "You have two strings, a and b. Find a string, s, such that:\n\n 1. s can be expressed as  s=sa+sb where sa is a non-empty substring of a and sb is a non-empty substring of b.\n 2. s is a palindromic string.\n3. The length of s is as long as possible.\nFor each of the q pairs of strings ( ai and bi) received as input, find and print string si on a new line. If you're able to form more than one valid string si, print whichever one comes first alphabetically. If there is no valid answer, print -1 instead.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer, q, denoting the number of queries. The subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:\n\n1.The first line contains a single string denoting a.\n2.The second line contains a single string denoting b.\nConstraints\n1.1<=q<=10                                \n2.1<=|a|,|b|<=10^5                            \n3. a and b  contain only lowercase English letters.    \n4.Sum of |a| over all queries does not exceed 2x10^5\n5. Sum of |b| over all queries does not exceed 2x10^5\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each pair of strings ( ai and bi), find some si satisfying the conditions above and print it on a new line.
