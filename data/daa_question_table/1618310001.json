To control her dragons she speaks random but powerful words. The strength of her words can be predicted by a strange rule. Rule : Strength of a word is sum of square of size of palindromic substrings in the word. To recall the definition of palindrome, palindrome is a word which reads same when read forward and backward. For example, word \"abaa\" has 6 palindromic substrings. \"aba\",\"aa\",\"a\",\"b\",\"a\",\"a\" with sizes 3,2,1,1,1,1 respectively. Their squares are 9,4,1,1,1,1. Hence total strength is 17. Given a queens word ind its strength.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input is T, number of test cases. Followed by T lines, each line containing a word.(only lowercase letters).\n\nOutput\n\nFind Strength of each word.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= Size of word <= 1000\n\n1 <= T <=100", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nabaa\ncbc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "3\naaa\naaa\naaa\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20\n20\n20", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
