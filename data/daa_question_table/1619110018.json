Hence, he plays a game.\n\nThe Monk is given N numbers and has to select K of these numbers. For each number that Monk chooses, he will get as many cheesecakes as the number of 1's in the Binary representation of the number i.e. the number of bits that are set.\n\nHelp Monk find the maximum number of cakes that he can have.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains T. T test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test cases contains 2 space-separated integers N and K.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test cases, print the answer in a new line.\n\nConstraints:\n1=  T = 10\n1 = N = 10^3\n0 = K = N\n0 = Numbers = 10^5", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4 2\n6 1 2 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2 2\n1 3\n4 2\n3 5 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n3 2\n1 4 5\n4 2\n5 3 4 2\n2 2\n3 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n4\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n2 2\n3 4\n4 3\n5 6 7 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n7", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
