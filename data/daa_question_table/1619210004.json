{"Q_ID": "1619210004", "S_NAME": "Sum of Subsets", "Q_NAME": "Utkarsh and Sub Array Xor", "Q_DESC": "Problem Statement\n\nUtkarsh loves binary sequences. Once he was playing with his favorite binary sequence of length N. But somehow he misplaced it. He remembers the bitwise XOR of exactly K subarrays. Utkarsh fears that you will steal his sequence so he will not reveal the actual XOR value of any sub array.\n\nHe plans to recover the sequence using this information only. You being his best friend will convince him there are just too many sequences satisfying the Sub Array Xor and its better to forget his love for that sequence.\n\nInput format:\nThe first line contains N and K. K lines follow.\nEach line contains two integers u v denoting S[u] XOR .. XOR S[v] is known.\n\nOutput format:\nPrint K integers, ith integer being the maximum number of binary sequences of length N satisfying first i XOR constraints. \nAs the answer can be large, output each result mod 109+7\n\nNote: A binary sequence is a sequence consisting of 0's and 1's only.\nS is one-indexed.\n\nConstraints:\n1  N  10^15\n1  K  min(10^6, N(N+1)/2)\n1  u  v  N*\n\nSAMPLE INPUT", "TESTCASE_1": "5 3\n1 1\n2 3\n5 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16\n8\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "4 3\n2 2\n2 3\n5 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n4\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
