The need of the hour is to set up efficient virus detectors. You are the lead at Central Hospital and need to find a fast and reliable way to detect the 'foot-prints' of the virus DNA in that of the patient.\n\nThe DNA of the patient as well as of the virus consists of lower case letters. Since the data collected is raw, there may be some errors. You will need to find all substrings in the patient DNA that either exactly matches the virus DNA, or has at most one mismatch.\n\nFor example: aa and aa are matching, ab and aa are matching, while ab and ba are not.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. \nEach case contains two strings P(Patient DNA) and V(Virus DNA) separated by space.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 = T = 10 \nP and V contain at most 100000 characters each. \nAll characters in P and V are lowercase letters.\n\nOutput Format\n\nOutput T lines, one corresponding to each test case. For each test case, output a space delimited list of starting indices (0 indexed) of substrings of P which are matching with V according to the condition mentioned above. The indices have to be in an increasing order. If there is no matching output No Match!.", "TESTCASE_1": "3  \nabbab ba\nhello world\nbanana nan\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2\n\n0 2", "TESTCASE_2": "2  \ncar c\nSrmSrm srm\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0 1 2\n0 3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
