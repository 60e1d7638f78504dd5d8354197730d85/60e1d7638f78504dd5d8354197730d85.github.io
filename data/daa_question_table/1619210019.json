For each query, count and print the number of different substrings of s in the inclusive range between left  and right.\n\nNote: Two substrings are different if their sequence of characters differs by at least one. For example, given the string  s=aab, substrings  s[0,0]=a and s[1][1]= a are the same but substrings  s[0,1]=aa and s[1,2]= ab are different.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and q. \nThe second line contains a single string denoting s. \nEach of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of left and right for a query.\n\nConstraints\n1. 0<=left<=right<=n-1\n2.String s consists of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a to z) only.\nSubtasks\n\nFor 30% of the test cases,1<=n, q<=100 \nFor 50% of the test cases, 1<=n, q<=3000 \nFor 100% of the test cases,1<=n, q<=10^5 \nOutput Format\n\nFor each query, print the number of different substrings in the inclusive range between index left and index right on a new line.", "TESTCASE_1": "5 5\naabaa\n1 1\n1 4\n1 1\n1 4\n0 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n8\n1\n8\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "4 4\ncaac\n1 4\n1 1\n1 4\n0 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n1\n6\n5", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
