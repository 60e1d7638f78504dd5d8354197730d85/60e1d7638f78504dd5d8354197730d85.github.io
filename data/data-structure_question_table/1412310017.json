Each question has a difficulty level in the form of an Integer. Now, Monk can only solve the problems that have difficulty level less than X . Now the rules are-\n\nScore of the student is equal to the maximum number of answers he/she has attempted without skipping a question.\nStudent is allowed to skip just \"one\" question that will not be counted in the continuity of the questions.\nNote- Assume the student knows the solution to the problem he/she attempts and always starts the paper from first question.\n\nGiven the number of Questions, N ,the maximum difficulty level of the problem Monk can solve , X ,and the difficulty level of each question , Ai can you help him determine his maximum score?\n\nInput Format\nFirst Line contains Integer \nN , the number of questions and the maximum difficulty \nX Monk can solve.Next line contains N integers, Ai denoting the difficulty level of each question.
