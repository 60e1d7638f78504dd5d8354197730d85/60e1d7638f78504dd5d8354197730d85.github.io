Each of them had a set of numbers (may contain a number more than once) to play with. Lets denote by A[] the set belonging to Monk, and by B[], the set belonging to Monk.\n\nThey defined three functions f(x) , g(x) and V(x) :\nf(x) : Returns count of numbers strictly smaller than xx in opponent's set\ng(x): Returns count of numbers strictly greater than xx in opponent's set\nV(x): f(x)*g(x)\n\nScore of a player is defined to be the V(x) for each element x present in the players set.\nThe player with higher score wins the game.\n\nInput: \n\tThe first line contains two positive integers N and M where N and M represent the number of elements present in Monk and !Monk's sets respectively.\n\n\tThe second line contains N space separated integers - elements present in Monk's set\n\tThe third line contains M space separated integers - elements present in !Monk's set\n\nOutput:\n\tIf Monk wins, print Monk (without quotes) followed by a space and the score difference between him and !Monk\n\tIf !Monk wins, print !Monk (without quotes) followed by a space and the score difference between him and Monk\n\tIf both players have equal scores, then print Tie (without quotes).\n\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n2 2 \n1 3 \n0 5 \nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nMonk 2\n\n3 3\n79837 255435 511328 \n329397 184646 135804\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n!Monk 4\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2 2\n1 3\n0 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMonk 2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 5\n2 3 6 8\n5 7 9 12 18\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nMonk 3", "TESTCASE_3": "3 3\n79837 255435 511328 \n329397 184646 135804\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n!Monk 4", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
