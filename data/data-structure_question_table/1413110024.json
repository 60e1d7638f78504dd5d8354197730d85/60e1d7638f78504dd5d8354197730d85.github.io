{"Q_ID": "1413110024", "S_NAME": "Searching Techniques", "Q_NAME": "Square Game", "Q_DESC": "Xsquare loves to play with numbers a lot. Today, he has a multi set S consisting of N integer elements. At first, he has listed all the subsets of his multi set S and later replaced all the subsets with the maximum element present in the respective subset.\nFor example :\nConsider the following multi set consisting of 3 elements S = {1,2,3}. \nList of all subsets:\n{}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{1,2}\n{2,3}\n{1,3}\n{1,2,3}\nFinal List:\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{2}\n{3}\n{3}\n{3}\nNow, Xsquare wonders that given an integer K how many elements in the final list are greater than ( > ) , less than ( < ) or equals to ( == ) K.\nTo make this problem a bit more interesting, Xsquare decided to add Q queries to this problem. Each of the queries has one of the following type.\n > K : Count the number of elements X in the final list such that X > K.\n < K : Count the number of elements X in the final list such that X < K.\n = K : Count the number of elements X in the final list such that X == K.\nNote:\n Answer to a particular query can be very large. Therefore, Print the required answer modulo 109+7.\n An empty subset is replaced by an integer 0.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains two space separated integers N and Q denoting the size of multiset S and number of queries respectively. Next line of input contains N space separated integers denoting elements of multi set S. Next Q lines of input contains Q queries each having one of the mentioned types.\nOutput\nFor each query, print the required answer modulo 109+7.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3 5\n1 2 3\n< 1\n> 1\n= 3\n= 2\n> 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n6\n4\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "3 5\n2 3 4\n< 2\n> 3\n= 1\n= 2\n> 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n4\n0\n1\n6", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
