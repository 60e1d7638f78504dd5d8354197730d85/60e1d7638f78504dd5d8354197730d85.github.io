After he finds out the length of longest subarray, he has to report how many subarrays of such maximum length exist that satisfy the mentioned property.\n\nNote:\nSubarray is defined as an array of contiguous numbers in a particular array. Subarray(A,B) has length (B-A+1) and consists of all numbers from index A to index B.\n\nInput:\nFirst Line of the input consists of a single integer N as described above. Next Line consists of N space separated integers.\n\nOutput:\nIn a single line, output the maximum length and number of such subarrays having maximum length separated by a single space.In case, there is no such subarray having sum greater than equal to zero, simply print \"-1\" without quotes.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n-1 -2 3 -1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 2", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n8 3 -2 5 -1 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6 1", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n4 3 15 -1 -5 21 99 -9 34 67\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10 1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
