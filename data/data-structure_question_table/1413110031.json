So, this is how it goes:\nGiven N points located on the co-ordinate plane, where the ith point is located at co-ordinate (xi, yi), you need to answer q queries.\nIn the ith query, you shall be given an integer ri, and considering you draw a circle centered at the origin (0,0)with radius ri, you need to report the number of points lying inside or on the circumference of this circle.\nFor each query, you need to print the answer on a new line.\nInput Format :\nThe first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of points lying on the co-ordinate plane. Each of the next N lines contains 2 space separated integers xi and yi, denoting the x and y co-ordintaes of the ithpoint.\nThe next line contains a single integer q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains a single integer, where the integer on the ith line denotes the parameters of the ith query ri.\nOutput Format :\nFor each query, print the answer on a new line\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n-1 -1\n4 4\n2\n3\n32\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n3 3\n-2 -2\n4 4\n11 11\n2\n6\n45\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
