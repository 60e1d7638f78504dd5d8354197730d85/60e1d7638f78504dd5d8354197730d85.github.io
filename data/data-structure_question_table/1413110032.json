His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x that is, A[i]=x; i=1=N such that product of all elements of this new array is strictly greater than the product of all elements of the initial array. \n\nNote that  x should be as minimum as possible such that it meets the given condition. Help him find the value of x.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.\nThe next line consists of N space separated integers, denoting the array elements.\n\nOutput Format:\nThe only line of output consists of value of x\n\nInput Constraints:\n \n1=N=10 to the power 5\n1=A[i]=10 to the power 10\nA[i] denoting an array element.\n\nInitial array product = 4*2*1*10*6=480.\nIf all elements becomes 4 then product=4*4*4*4*4=1024.Had all elements become 3\n3, product would be =243 which is less than 480\n\nHence, value of \nx is 4", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n4 2 1 10 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n27 253 316 3830 2384\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n456", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
