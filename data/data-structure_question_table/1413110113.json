An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains size of the array\nThe second line contains the elements of the array.\n\nOutput:\nPrint leaders present in array\n\nMethod 1 (Simple)\nUse two loops. The outer loop runs from 0 to size  1 and one by one picks all elements from left to right. The inner loop compares the picked element to all the elements to its right side. If the picked element is greater than all the elements to its right side, then the picked element is the leader.", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n16 17 4 3 5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17\n5\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n1 2 3 4 9 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n1 8 4 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n4\n3\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
