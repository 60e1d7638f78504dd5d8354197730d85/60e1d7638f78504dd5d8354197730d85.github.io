There are K identical assignees available and we are also given how much time an assignee takes to do one unit of job. Find the minimum time to finish all jobs with following constraints.\n\nAn assignee can be assigned only contiguous jobs. For example, an assignee cannot be assigned jobs 1 and 3, but not 2.\nTwo assignees cannot share (or co-assigned) a job, i.e., a job cannot be partially assigned to one assignee and partially to other. \nInput\nNumber of jobs, array of jobs, K identical assignees available and the time T, an assignee takes to do one unit of job.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n10 7 8 12 6 8\n4\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n75", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n4 5 10\n2\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n50", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n6 9\n1\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n30", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
