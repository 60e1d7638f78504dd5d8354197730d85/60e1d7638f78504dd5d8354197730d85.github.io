You are also given the value of \"K\" i.e. the total kilometers a car can drive on each sub-track. If the car can't cover a sub-track, you can add any unit of Petrol in it. With each unit of petrol added, the total kilometers your car can travel will increase by one unit .\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers (A[])  denoting the distance of each N sub-tracks.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case in a new line you have to print out the minimum unit of Petrol your car require to cover all the sub-tracks. If no extra unit of petrol is required, print -1.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 7\n2 5 4 5 2\n5 4\n1 6 3 5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n4 6\n2 3 7 5\n7 4\n1 2 3 5 2 4 3\n5 3\n4 7 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n3 5\n2 3 4 1 2\n5 4\n2 6 3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
