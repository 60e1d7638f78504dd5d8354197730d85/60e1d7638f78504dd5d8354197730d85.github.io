{"Q_ID": "1414210013", "S_NAME": "Sorting Techniques", "Q_NAME": "Gotta catch 'em all! ", "Q_DESC": "Little Arihant has always wanted to be the best Pokemon trainer in this world. And he thinks he has achieved his goal, so he wants to quickly go and meet Professor Oak and verify this fact. But like all Pokemon trainers, he has a weird habit, too. He catches Pokemons which can go through evolution to become a better one. After roaming in the Pokeworld for days, he has finally managed to catch k such Pokemons.\n\nThe way he can make a Pokemon go through evolution is NOT by making them fight battles, but by using an evolution stone. Since he has k Pokemons, he naturally needs k evolution stones for every one of them, as well.\n\nNow it takes little Arihant one complete day, to use the evolution stone on one Pokemon. And for each Pokemon, he knows how many days will they take to evolute after the evolution stone has been used on them.\n\nHe will go to meet Professor Oak, the very next day, once all his Pokemons have gone through evolution. He can select the order of applying evolution stones as he likes, so he wants to do it in such a way that he gets to meet Professor Oak as soon as possible!\n\nInput Format:\nThe input has two lines. The first line will contain an integer k, which denotes the number of Pokemons. Then, a line with k integers follows, where the i-th integer denotes the number of days it takes for the i-th Pokemon to evolve.\n\nOutput Format:\nYou need to print the earliest day when little Arihant can go meet Professor Oak.\n\nConstraints:\nThe days are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "12 \n1727 1300 1169 1770 945 1302 42 755 1067 1823 572 461\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1825", "TESTCASE_3": "80\n1330 67 1212 420 1688 311 1725 92 1404 11 558 756 910 1099 364 1092 1683 1830 1294 1427 952 1657 295 1321 1976 1368 1934 1990 1511 1817 676 662 179 1648 1542 521 1452 199 586 1543 65 644 1741 857 1804 1363 435 25 12 736 1714 927 1336 626 208 149 713 632 39 15 767 428 698 1929 686 1729 911 1428 378 1288 1441 1427 490 379 1148 74 296 285 1501 1088\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1992", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
