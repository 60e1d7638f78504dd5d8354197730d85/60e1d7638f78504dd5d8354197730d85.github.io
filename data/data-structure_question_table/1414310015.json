He wants to calculate the Overall Power of the all N Boxes.\n\nOverall Power here means Sum of Absolute Difference of the strengths of the boxes(between each pair of boxes) multiplied by the Maximum strength among N boxes. Since the Overall Power could be a very large number,output the number modulus 10^9+7(1000000007).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T test cases. Each test case has 2 lines. First line contains the number of boxes N. It is followed by a line containing N elements where ith element is the strength of Andrew's ith box.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single number, which is the Overall Power for that testcase.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n1 2\n5\n4 5 3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n100", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n2\n1 7\n3\n3 7 9\n1\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n42\n108\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2\n9 10\n4\n90 20 40 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n29000", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
