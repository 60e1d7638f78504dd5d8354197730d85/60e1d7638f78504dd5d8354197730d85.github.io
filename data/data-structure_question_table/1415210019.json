Delete last occurrence of key from linked. The list may have duplicates. The idea is to traverse the linked list from beginning to end. While traversing, keep track of last occurrence key. After traversing the complete list, delete last occurrence by copying data of next node and deleting the next node. \nINPUT:\n1 2 3 4 4 5//linked list \n4//key\nOUTPUT:\nCreated Linked List: \n1 2 3 4 4 5 \nLinked List after Deletion of element: \n1 2 3 4 5\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1 2 3 4 2 5 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nCreated Linked List: \n1 2 3 4 2 5 \nLinked List after Deletion of element: \n1 2 3 4 5", "TESTCASE_2": "3 3 4 3 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nCreated Linked List: \n3 3 4 3 2 1 \nLinked List after Deletion of element: \n3 3 4 2 1", "TESTCASE_3": "1 2 3 4 4 5 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nCreated Linked List: \n1 2 3 4 4 5 \nLinked List after Deletion of element: \n1 2 3 4 5", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
