Initially, your editor contains an empty string, . You must perform Q operations of the following 4 types:\n\nappend (W)- Append string W to the end of S .\ndelete (k)- Delete the last k characters of S .\nprint(k) - Print the Kth character of S.\nundo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2,reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer,Q , denoting the number of operations. \nEach line i of the Q subsequent lines (where 0=i)\nConstraints\n1=Q=10^6\n1=k=|S|\nThe sum of the lengths of all W in the input =10^6 .\nThe sum of k over all delete operations =2*10^6.\nAll input characters are lowercase English letters.\nIt is guaranteed that the sequence of operations given as input is possible to perform.\nOutput Format\n\nEach operation of type 3 must print the Kth character on a new line.", "TESTCASE_1": "8\n1 lmn\n3 3\n2 2\n1 xy\n3 2\n4 \n4 \n2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nn\nx", "TESTCASE_2": "8\n1 abc\n3 3\n2 3\n1 xy\n3 2\n4 \n4 \n3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nc\ny\na", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
