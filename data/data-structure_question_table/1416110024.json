{"Q_ID": "1416110024", "S_NAME": "Stack Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Stack 23", "Q_DESC": "You are a waiter at a party. There are N stacked plates on pile Ao . Each plate has a number written on it. Then there will be q iterations. In i-th iteration, you start picking up the plates in Ai-1 from the top one by one and check whether the number written on the plate is divisible by the -th prime. If the number is divisible, you stack that plate on pile Bi . Otherwise, you stack that plate on pile Ai . After Q iterations, plates can only be on pile B1,B2,......Bq, Aq . Output numbers on these plates from top to bottom of each piles in order of B1,B2,....Bq, Aq .\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains two space separated integers, N and Q. \nThe next line contains N space separated integers representing the initial pile of plates, i.e., Ao . The leftmost value represents the bottom plate of the pile.\n\nConstraints\n1<=N<=5*10^4\n2<=number(i)<=10^4\n1<=Q<=1200\n\n\n\nOutput Format\n\nOutput N lines. Each line contains a number written on the plate. Printing should be done in the order defined above.", "TESTCASE_1": "5 1\n3 4 7 6 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n6\n3\n7\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "6 1 \n8 1 9 2 7 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n2\n1\n9\n7\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
