Now Shrija is very angry . Seeing her sister angry he promises to arrange them on N empty stacks numbered from 1 to N .\nShrija also felt that she should help her brother in arranging the books. So she gives Vaibhav a sequence of M instructions each of the form A B, meaning that Vaibhav should add one new book to the top of each stack in the range A..B. For example, if Vaibhav is told 10 13, then he should add a book to each of the stacks 10, 11, 12, and 13.\nAfter Vaibhav finishes stacking books according to the instructions, Shrija would like to know the median height of the N stacks i.e. the height of the middle stack if the stacks were to be arranged in sorted order (Assume N is odd, so median is unique). Please help Shrija in finding the answer .\n\n\n\nInput\nLine 1: Two space-separated integers, N M.\n\nLines 2 to 1+M: Each line contains one of Shrija's instructions in the\nform of two space separated integers A B (1 = A = B = N).\n\nOutput\nOnly 1 integer which is the required answer.\n\nConstraints\n1 N 100000\n1 M 10000", "TESTCASE_1": "5 3\n2 4\n1 3\n3 5\n\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 2\n3 6\n1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
