Each pile could be increased or decreased by adding or removing stones to it. So, he decided to put them in such a order that\nthe stones in ith pile is equal to the stones in (N+1-i)th, i.e., H[i] = H[N+1-i].\nIt is also said that the height of each pile indexed from 1 to N/2 are in single step increasing order and then from N/2 to N it decreases in single step. Output the number of piles on which he should work to make the required pattern\n\nRequired pattern of piles are shown in two figures 1 and 2.\nFigure 1 shows the pattern when N is 8 (i.e., even).\nFigure 2 shows the pattern when N is 9 (i.e., odd).\n\nClick here for figure 1 and 2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T denoting the number of test cases.\nNext T lines contains N the numbers of piles.\nNext line contains N space separated heights of each pile.\nOutput\nPrint minimum number of piles on which he should increase or decrease the stones so that he obtains the required pattern.\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 100000\n1 <= H[i] <= 100000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4\n1 2 2 1\n5\n1 2 1 3 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n2\n", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n3\n3 4 2\n5\n1 3 6 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
