Moreover, each \">\" symbol should correspond to exactly one \"<\" symbol.\n\nSo, for instance, the instructions:\n\n<<>>\n\n<>\n\n<><>\n\nare all valid. While:\n\n>>\n\n><><\n\nare not.\n\nGiven some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix.\n\nInput\nInput will consist of an integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.\n\nThen, T strings follow, each on a single line, representing a possible expression in L++.\n\nOutput\nFor each expression you should output the length of the longest prefix that is valid or 0 if there's no such a prefix.\n\nConstraints\n1  T  500\n1  The length of a single expression  106\nThe total size all the input expressions is no more than 5*106\n ", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n<<>>\n><\n<>>>\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n<<<>>\n><>>\n<<>>\n<>><\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0\n4\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
