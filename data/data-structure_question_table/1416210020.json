Meanwhile their friend Hermoine is stuck on some silly arrays problem. Harry does not have time for all this, so he asked Monk to solve that problem for Hermoine, so that they can go.\nThe problem is given an array A having N integers, for each i(1iN), find x+y, where x is the largest number less than i such that A[x]A[i] and y is the smallest number greater than i such that A[y]A[i]. If there is no xi such that A[x]A[i], then take x=1. Similarly, if there is no yi such that A[y]A[i], then take y=1.\nInput Format:\nFirst line consists of a single integer denoting N.\nSecond line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.\nOutput Format:\nPrint N space separated integers, denoting x+y for each  i(1iN)\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n5 4 1 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-2 0 6 1 3", "TESTCASE_2": "10\n1 2 3 4 5 6 2 9 7 8 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 3 4 5 7 14 -2 18 7 ", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
