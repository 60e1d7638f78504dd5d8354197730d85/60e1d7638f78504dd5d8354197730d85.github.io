They decide to judge the best among them by competing. They do so by comparing their three skills as per their values. Please help them doing so as they are busy.\n\nSet for A are like [a1, a2, a3]\nSet for B are like [b1, b2, b3]\n\nCompare ith skill of A with ith skill of B\nif a[i]  b[i] , A's score increases by 1\nif a[i]  b[i] , B's score increases by 1\n\n\nInput : \nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the Test cases. Then T test cases folllow. The second line of each test case contains Skill values of A . The third line of each test case contains Skill values of B\n \n\nOutput : \nFor each test case in a new line print the score of A and B separated by space.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4 2 7\n5 6 3\n4 2 7\n5 2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2\n0 2", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n6 2 7\n5 6 3\n6 2 7\n5 2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2 1\n1 1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
