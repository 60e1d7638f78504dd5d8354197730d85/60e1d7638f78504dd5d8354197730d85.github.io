{"Q_ID": "1417110010", "S_NAME": "Queue  Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Circular Truck Tour", "Q_DESC": "Suppose there is a circle. There are N petrol pumps on that circle. Petrol pumps are numbered 1 to N (both inclusive). You have two pieces of information corresponding to each of the petrol pump: \n\n(1) the amount of petrol that particular petrol pump will give, and \n(2) the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump.\n\nInitially, you have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. You can start the tour at any of the petrol pumps. Calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle. Consider that the truck will stop at each of the petrol pumps. The truck will move one kilometer for each litre of the petrol.Using a circular queue implement this problem.(The truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity).\n\nINPUT:\n\nThe first line will contain the value of N.The next N lines will contain a pair of integers for each petrol pump, i.e. the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give and the distance between that petrol pump and the next petrol pump.Note: Position of petrol pump is from 1 to N according to the input given.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nAn integer which will be the petrol pump from which we can start the tour and where a truck will be able to complete the circle.Note:The output must contain the position of petrol pump in the circle.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n1 5\n10 3\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n6 4\n3 6\n7 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n4 6\n6 5 \n7 3\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
