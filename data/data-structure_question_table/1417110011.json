{"Q_ID": "1417110011", "S_NAME": "Queue  Implementation", "Q_NAME": "First non-repeating character in a stream", "Q_DESC": "Given an input stream of n characters consisting only of small case alphabets,the task is to find the first non repeating character each time a character is inserted to the stream by using a queue of characters.For example, In a flow of stream : a, a, b, c\n\na goes to stream : 1st non repeating element : a (a)\na goes to stream : no non repeating element: 0 (a, a)\nb goes to stream: 1st non repeating element: b (a, a, b)\nc goes to stream : 1st non repeating element: b(a, a, b, c)\n\nINPUT:\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases.Then,T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the stream. Then, in the next line are the characters which are inserted to the stream.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nFor each test case in a new line print the first non repeating elements separated by spaces present in the stream at every instinct when a character is added to the stream, if no such element is present print 0.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4\na a b c\n3\na a c\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\na 0 b b \na 0 c", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5\na b a b c\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\na a b 0 c", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n4\na b c a\n1\nd\n7\na b c d b a d\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\na a a b \nd \na a a a a c c", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
