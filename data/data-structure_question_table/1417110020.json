{"Q_ID": "1417110020", "S_NAME": "Queue  Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Distance of nearest cell having 1 using BFS queue", "Q_DESC": "Given a binary matrix of 3 x 4, containing 0 and 1.The task is to find the distance of nearest 1 in the matrix for each cell. The distance is calculated as |i1  i2| + |j1  j2|, where i1, j1 are the row number and column number of the current cell and i2, j2 are the row number and column number of the nearest cell having value 1.Consider each cell as a node of a graph and each boundary between any two adjacent cells be an edge.Apply BFS using this queue to find the minimum distance of the adjacent node.\n\nFor example, Consider this matrix of 3 x 4:\n\nmat[ ][ ] = \n{  0, 0, 0, 1,\n    0, 0, 1, 1,\n    0, 1, 1, 0 \n }\n\nOutput : 3 2 1 0\n               2 1 0 0\n               1 0 0 1\n\nFor cell at (0, 0), nearest 1 is at (0, 3),\nso distance = (0 - 0) + (3 - 0) = 3\n\nSimilarly all the distance can be calculated\n\nINPUT:\nThe input consists of the 3x4 graph matrix containing 0 and 1\n\nOUTPUT:\nThe matrix containing the minimum distance of nearest 1 in the matrix for each cell.", "TESTCASE_1": "0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 2 1 0 \n2 1 0 0 \n1 0 0 1", "TESTCASE_2": "0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 1 0 \n1 1 2 1 \n0 0 1 0", "TESTCASE_3": "0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2 2 1 0 \n1 1 0 1 \n0 0 1 2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
