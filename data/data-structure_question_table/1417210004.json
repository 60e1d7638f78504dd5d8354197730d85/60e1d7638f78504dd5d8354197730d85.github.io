{"Q_ID": "1417210004", "S_NAME": "Queue  Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Hostel Visit using priority queue", "Q_DESC": "Dean of SRM university is going to visit Hostels in the campus. As you know that he is a very busy person, he decided to visit only first \"K\" nearest Hostels. Hostels are situated in 2D plane. You are given the coordinates of hostels and you have to answer the Rocket distance of Kth nearest hostel from origin ( Dean's place ).Using priority queues, find the rocket distance of Kth nearest hostel from origin.\n\nINPUT: \nFirst line of input contains Q Total no. of queries and K \nThere are two types of queries: \nfirst type : 1 x y \nFor query of 1st type, you came to know about the co-ordinates ( x , y ) of newly constructed hostel.\nsecond type : 2 \nFor query of 2nd type, you have to output the Rocket distance of Kth nearest hostel till now. \nThe Dean will always stay at his place ( origin ).\nIt is gauranted that there will be atleast k queries of type 1 before first query of type 2. \nRocket distance between two points ( x2 , y2 ) and ( x1 , y1 ) is defined as (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 \n\nOUTPUT:\nFor each query of type 2 output the Rocket distance of Kth nearest hostel from Origin. \n\nEXPLANATION:\nConsider the input as:\n9 3\n1 10 10\n1 9 9\n1 -8 -8\n2\n1 7 7\n2\n1 6 6 \n1 5 5\n2\nThe rocket distance of first k ( = 3 ) hostels in increasing order are 128 , 162 , 200 The Rocket distance of 3rd nearest hostel till now is 200. \nAfter another query of type 1 , the rocket distance of hostels in increasing order are 98 ,128 , 162 , 200. The Rocket distance of 3rd nearest hostel till now is 162. After 2 query of type 1, the rocket distance of hostels in increasing order are 50 , 72 ,98 , 128 ,162 , 200. The Rocket distance of 3rd nearest hostel till now is 98. Hence,Output will be:\n200\n162\n98", "TESTCASE_1": "9 3\n1 10 10\n1 9 9\n1 -8 -8\n2\n1 7 7\n2\n1 6 6 \n1 5 5\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n200\n162\n98", "TESTCASE_2": "8 3\n1 5 6\n1 -9 8\n1 -6 -8\n2\n1 4 7\n2\n1 2 6 \n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n145\n100\n65", "TESTCASE_3": "9 1\n1 5 6\n1 -9 8\n1 -6 -8\n2\n1 4 7\n2\n1 2 6 \n1 8 -2\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n61\n61\n40", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
