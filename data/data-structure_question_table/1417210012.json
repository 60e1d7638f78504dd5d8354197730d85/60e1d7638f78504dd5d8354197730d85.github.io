Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated values n and e denoting the no of nodes and edges respectively. Then in the next line two lines are 2*e space separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v for the both trees .\n\nOUTPUT:\nFor each test case in a new line print 1 if both the trees are mirrors of each other else print 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3 2\n1 2 1 3\n1 3 1 2\n3 2\n1 2 1 3\n1 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n7 6\n1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7\n1 3 1 2 2 5 2 4 3 7 3 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n7 6\n1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7\n1 3 1 2 2 5 2 4 3 7 3 6\n7 6\n1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7\n1 3 1 2 2 5 2 4 3 7 3 8\n8 7\n1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7 7 9\n1 3 1 2 2 5 2 4 3 7 3 6 7 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
