{"Q_ID": "1417210017", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Little Monk and Root", "Q_DESC": "Little Monk finally meets another favorite cricketer of his: Joe Root.He wants to show Root the power of his magical function. Little Monk's function has the special ability to reduce a number to its one third value. Mathematically, f(x) = ceiling (x/3), where ceiling(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.\n\nThe Monk wants to reduce the career average of Root's career, so he decides to apply the function K number of times on various innings of his career. He can, of course, apply the function on the same innings multiple times. You're given the number of N innings and the runs scored by Root in his career, and you've to help reduce Root's final career average by applying Monk's special function K number of times on the innings of his career. And print his original average and his new career average.Use priority queue and solve the problem.\n\nINPUT:\nThe first line contains two integers, N and K, denoting the number of innings of Root and the number of times the Monk can apply the magical function. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the runs scored by Root in each innings.\n\nOUTPUT:\nYou've to print the initial career average of Joe Root, and the new average on the same line separated by a space. The difference till 10^6 in the answer will be accepted.\n\nNote: You can safely assume that Joe Root was dismissed in every inning he played, so the role of a not-out in an innings is not important. Also, the difference till 10^6 in the answer will be accepted.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nConsider the input as:\n5 1\n20 30 40 50 60\nThe initial scores: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.\nThe new scores after the function: 20, 30, 40, 50, 20.\nThe output will be:\n40.000000 32.000000", "TESTCASE_1": "5 1\n20 30 40 50 60\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n40.000000 32.000000", "TESTCASE_2": "6 3\n42 48 72 34 78 90\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n60.666667 34.000000", "TESTCASE_3": "10 4\n24 12 19 91 54 59 37 78 89 120\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n58.300000 33.200000", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
