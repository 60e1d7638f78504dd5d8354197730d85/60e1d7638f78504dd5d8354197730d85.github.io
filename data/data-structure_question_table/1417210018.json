{"Q_ID": "1417210018", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Aniruddha's Queue", "Q_DESC": "Aniruddha is given a milestone M to reach in terms of distance. He is living in a different Galaxy where there are N days in a year.At the ith day he can walk atmost X distance.Assuming he walks optimally you need to output the minimum day number on which he will reach the milestone.\n\nINPUT:\nThe first input line contains the T number of testcases. Each testcase consist of three lines First line consist of single integer N  the number of days in a year.Next line contains N non-negative space-separated numbers i.e. distance which Aniruddha will walk on ith day. It is guaranteed that at least one of those numbers is greater than zero.And the third line consist of the value of milestone which Aniruddha has to reach.\n\nOUTPUT:\nFor each testcase you need to output the answer to the following query.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nConsider the input as:\n2\n5\n1 5 0 0 2\n9\n3\n1 0 3\n2\nFor the first testcase we have to reach a milestone of 9 units. On the 1st day we would cover at most 1 unit.On the 2nd day we would cover at most 5 units.So total distance covered till 2nd day is 6 units.On 3rd and 4th day he would not cover any distance as value of X on those days is 0. On the 5th day he would cover at most 2 units. So total distance covered till 5th day is 8 units.Then he will go to the first day of the next year.So total distance covered till 1st day will now become 9 units which is equal to the milestone. So answer is 1.Similarly answer for second testcase is 3.Hence,the output will be:\n1\n3", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5\n1 5 0 0 2\n9\n3\n1 0 3\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n7\n5 0 1 4 0 3 2\n12\n10\n2 0 9 0 8 0 1 0 3 5\n17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n5", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n4\n2 0 0 1\n1\n5\n8 7 0 2 1\n16\n7\n0 1 0 2 4 5 6\n11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n4\n6", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
