{"Q_ID": "1417210023", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Signal Range", "Q_DESC": "Various signal towers are present in a city.Towers are aligned in a straight horizontal line(from left to right) and each tower transmits a signal in the right to left direction.Tower A shall block the signal of Tower B if Tower A is present to the left of Tower B and Tower A is taller than Tower B. So,the range of a signal of a given tower can be defined as :\n\n{(the number of contiguous towers just to the left of the given tower whose height is less than or equal to the height of the given tower) + 1}.\n\nYou need to find the range of each tower.\n\nINPUT\n\nFirst line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases.\n\nSecond line contains an integer n specifying the number of towers.\n\nThird line contains n space separated integers(H[i]) denoting the height of each tower.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nPrint the range of each tower (separated by a space).", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n7\n100 80 60 70 60 75 85\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 1 2 1 4 6 ", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5\n80 60 40 10 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 1 1 5 ", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
