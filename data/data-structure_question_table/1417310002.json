{"Q_ID": "1417310002", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List Representation", "Q_DESC": "Given Linked List Representation of Complete Binary Tree, construct the Binary tree. A complete binary tree can be represented in an array in the following approach.\nIf root node is stored at index i, its left, and right children are stored at indices 2*i+1, 2*i+2 respectively.We know head of linked list is always is root of the tree. We take the first node as root and we also know that the next two nodes are left and right children of root.Using Level order traversal of the partially built Binary Tree using queue and traverse the linked list at the same time. At every step, we take the parent node from queue, make next two nodes of linked list as children of the parent node, and enqueue the next two nodes to queue.For example,consider the linked list from last to head node: 36 30 25 15 12 10 Thus,the linked list will be: 10-12-15-25-30-36 The complete binary tree from the linked list can be:\n         10\n       /       \\\n     12        15\n     /   \\         /  \n   25   30     36\n\nINPUT:\nThe first line of input consists of size of the linked list S which is followed by linked list of integers from last node to first node.Note:The elements will be in descending order from last node to first node.\n\nOUTPUT:\nThe inorder traversal of tree should be printed.", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n36 30 25 15 12 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n25 12 30 10 36 15", "TESTCASE_2": "7\n45 42 34 28 22 11 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n28 11 34 5 42 22 45", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n56 55 46 36 24 22 13 11 7 6 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n46 13 55 7 56 22 6 24 11 36", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
