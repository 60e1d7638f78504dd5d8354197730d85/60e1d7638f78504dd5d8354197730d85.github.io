{"Q_ID": "1417310005", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Max in Queue", "Q_DESC": "You have been given a sequence of N digits. Each digit in this sequence ranges from 1 to 100.You need to perform 2 types of operations on this list:\n-Add(x): Add element x to the end of the list.(type-1)\n-Max(list): Find the maximum element in the current sequence.(type-2)\nFor each query of type 2, you need to print the result of that operation.Using priority queue, solve the problem.\n\nINPUT:\nThe first line consist of a single integer N denoting the size of the initial sequence. The next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the elements of the initial sequence. The next line contains a single integer q denoting the number of queries. The next q lines contains the details of the operation. The first integer type indicates the type of query. If typei ==1, it is followed by another integer x and you need to perform operation of type 1 else operations of type 2\n\nOUTPUT:\nFor each operation of the second type, print a single integer on a new line.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n8 1 2 4 6 7\n4\n1 5\n2\n1 9\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n9", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n18 11 21 41 61 71 24 80 12 81\n6\n1 51\n2\n1 91\n2\n1 80\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n81\n91\n91", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
