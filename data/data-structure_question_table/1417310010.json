{"Q_ID": "1417310010", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Minimum Cost of ropes", "Q_DESC": "There are given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. We need to connect the ropes with minimum cost.Using heaps and priority queue,solve the problem.\n\nINPUT:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case is N,N is the number of ropes.\nThe second line of each test case contains N input L[i],length of ropes.\n\nOUTPUT:\nPrint the minimum cost for each test case in a new line.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n1\n4\n4 3 2 6\nOutput:\n29\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor example if we are given 4 ropes of lengths 4, 3, 2 and 6. We can connect the ropes in following ways.\n1) First connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3. Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6 and 5.\n2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5. Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9.\n3) Finally connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected.\n\nTotal cost for connecting all ropes is 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost for connecting ropes. Other ways of connecting ropes would always have same or more cost. For example, if we connect 4 and 6 first (we get three strings of 3, 2 and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we get two strings of 13 and 2). Finally we connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n4 3 2 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n29", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n5\n10 13 11 6 8\n4 \n6 3 9 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n110\n36", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n5\n10 23 45 12 7\n3\n12 56 34\n6\n10 96 23 34 45 12\n4\n9 2 1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n195\n148\n490\n26", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
