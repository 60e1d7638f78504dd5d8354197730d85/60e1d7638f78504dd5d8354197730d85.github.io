{"Q_ID": "1417310016", "S_NAME": "Queue Implementation", "Q_NAME": "Transform the Expression", "Q_DESC": "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For instance, to add three and four, one would write 3 4 + rather than 3 + 4. If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written 3  4 + 5 would be written 3 4  5 + first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.\nTransform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form.\nYou can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c)\nInput\nThe first line containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400.\nOutput\nThe expressions in RPN form, one per line.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "(a+(b*c))\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nabc*+", "TESTCASE_2": "((a+b)*(z+x))\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nab+zx+*", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
