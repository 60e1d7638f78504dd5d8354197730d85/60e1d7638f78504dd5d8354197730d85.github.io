{"Q_ID": "1418210007", "S_NAME": "Tree", "Q_NAME": "Dwayne and Cursed Tree", "Q_DESC": "Dwayne has an array A having N distinct integers and a Binary Search Tree which is initially empty. He inserts all the elements of the array from index 1 to N in the BST in the order given in the array. But wait! The tree so formed turns out to be cursed. Dwayne is having some weird experiences since he made that tree.\nSo, now to stop all that, Dwayne has two options, to destroy the BST or to pray to God and ask for a solution. Now since Dwayne has to use this BST in a Code Challenge, he cannot destroy it. So he prays to God.\n\nGod answer his prayers and sends an angel named Micro. Now, Micro asks Dwayne to find something. He tells him two values, X and Y, present in the BST and ask him to find the maximum value that lie in the path between node having value X and node having value Y. (including X and Y ).\n\nNow since, Dwayne is very afraid of that tree he asks for your help.\n\nInput:\nFirst line consists of a single integer denoting N.Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.Third line consists of two space separated integers denoting X and Y.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the maximum value that lie in the path from node having value X and node having value Y in a new line.\n\nConstraints:\n1N10^5\n1A[i]10^9 \nIt is ensured that values X and Y are present in the array.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n4 7 8 6 3\n3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
