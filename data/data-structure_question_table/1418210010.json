Manchester United has qualified for the Champions League Final which is to be held at the Wembley Stadium in London. So, he decided to go there and watch his favourite team play. After reaching the stadium, he saw that many people have lined up for the match tickets. He knows that there are M rows in the stadium with different seating capacities. They may or may not be equal. The price of the ticket depends on the row. If the row has K(always greater than 0) vacant seats, then the price of the ticket will be K pounds(units of British Currency). Now, every football fan standing in the line will get a ticket one by one.\nGiven the seating capacities of different rows, find the maximum possible pounds that the club will gain with the help of the ticket sales.\n\nInput:\nThe first line consists of M and N. M denotes the number of seating rows in the stadium and N denotes the number of football fans waiting in the line to get a ticket for the match.\nNext line consists of M space separated integers X[1],X[2],X[3].... X[M] where X[i] denotes the number of empty seats initially in the ith row.\n\nOutput:\nPrint in a single line the maximum pounds the club will gain.\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= M <= 1000000\n1 <= N <= 1000000\n1 <= X[i] <= 1000000\nSum of X[i] for all 1 <= i <= M will always be greater than N.", "TESTCASE_1": "3 4\n1 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
