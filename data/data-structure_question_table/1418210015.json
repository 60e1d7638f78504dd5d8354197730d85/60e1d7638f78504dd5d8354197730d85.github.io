{"Q_ID": "1418210015", "S_NAME": "Tree", "Q_NAME": "Jake And IQ", "Q_DESC": "Jake and his P-1 friends recently joined a college. He finds that N students have already applied for different courses before him. Courses are assigned numbers from 1 to C. He and his friends will follow the following conditions when choosing courses:- \nThey will choose the course i (1 <= i <= C), for which the value of z is minimum. Here, z = x*c where c is the number of students already enrolled in the course i and x is the sum of IQ of the last two students who enrolled in that course. If a single student has applied for a course, then the value of x will be that student's IQ. If no student has enrolled for that course, then value of x will be 0. If the value of z is same for two courses, then they will choose the course with the minimum course number. You need to find which courses Jake and his friends should take after following the above conditions.\nNote: Each of them will choose their courses, one at a time. Jake will choose his course first followed by his friends.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains the numbers C, P and N where C denotes the number of courses in that college, P denotes Jake and his friends and N denotes the number of students who have already applied for the courses.\nThe next line consists of N space separated integers Y[i] which denotes the IQ of the ith student. Here, the ith student chooses the ith course. \nThe next line consists of P space separated integers X[i] which denotes the IQ of Jake and his friends.\n\nOutput:\nPrint P space separated integers in a line which denotes the course number which Jake and his friends have applied for.\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= C <= 100000\n1 <= P <= 100000\n1 <= N <= C\n1 <= Y[i],X[i] <= 100000", "TESTCASE_1": "5 4 4\n2 8 5 1\n9 10 5 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5 4 1 3", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
