{"Q_ID": "1418310005", "S_NAME": "Tree", "Q_NAME": "IRCTC", "Q_DESC": "Good news , You have a chance to work in IRCTC as a software developer . Applications are required with a program for railway sites . sid of a station is a something which uniquely defines it . Given N station's sid from 1 to N and distance between any two stations , if any person wants to go from station having sid A to another station C via station B as early as possible , where time is directly proportional to distance . What you have to do is to print the total distance and path to be covered by train if it exists , otherwise print No Train Found.. If a railway line connects station A to B with distance d than it means it will also connects station B to station A with same distance d .\n\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T tests cases. Each test case's first line contains two integers N and k , where N is the number of stations having sid from 1 to N and k is the number of railway lines which connects stations. Following k lines each contain three numbers a , b and d which represents station having sid a connects station b and distance between them is d . After that a line follows with number A , B , C , where A represents sid of the source station , C the destination station and B is the station via which person wants to go.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case , If there exists no paths as described in problem print No Train Found. otherwise in first line print the total distance and in second line path to be covered .\n\nConstraints\n1 = t = 100\n1 = k = 100000\n3 = N = 100000\n1 = A,B,C = N\n1 = d = 10000000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n6 6\n1 2 2\n2 5 5\n2 3 4\n1 4 1\n4 3 3\n3 5 1\n1 3 6\n10 10\n1 5 78\n1 8 221\n2 7 92\n2 8 159\n3 5 55\n3 6 179\n3 10 237\n4 8 205\n5 6 191\n8 10 157\n6 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo Train Found.\n692\n6 3 5 1 8 2 ", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
