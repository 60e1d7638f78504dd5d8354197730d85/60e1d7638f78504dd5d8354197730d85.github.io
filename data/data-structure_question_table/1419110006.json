Here is one more from our own Monk:\nGiven an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, what is the maximum number of edges in any connected component of the graph. In other words, if given graph has k connected components, and E1,E2,....Ek be the number of edges in the respective connected component, then find max(E1,E2,....,Ek) . The graph may have multiple edges and self loops. The N vertices are numbered as 1,2,...,N.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line of input consists of two space separated integers N and M, denoting number of vertices in the graph and number of edges in the graph respectively. Following M lines consists of two space separated each a and b, denoting there is an edge between vertex a and vertex b\n\nOutput Format:\nThe only line of output consists of answer of the question asked by Monk.", "TESTCASE_1": "6 3\n1 2\n2 3\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "5 4\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "5 4\n1 1\n4 4\n1 1\n2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
