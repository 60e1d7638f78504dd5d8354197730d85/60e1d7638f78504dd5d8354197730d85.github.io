He came across a very good problem.Problem is as follows: \nGiven a linear strip of length N. Strip consists of N cells painted in either BLACK or WHITE color. At each move you can do following \nprocess:\nTake any 2 or 3 contiguous cells.\nInvert their colors (i.e replace BLACK cells with WHITE cells and WHITE cells with BLACK cells).\nYou are required to answer minimum number of moves in which you can change all the cells into same color( either WHITE or BLACK).\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains N which represents length of strip.\nSecond line of input consists of string of length N. Each character of string will be W or B . B represents Black cell and W represents White cell.\n\nOutput\nMinimum number of moves in which you can change all the cells into same color .i.e make the whole strip consisting of cells having same color.", "TESTCASE_1": "7\nWWBBBWW\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "14\nBBWWBWWWWWWWWW\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
