He makes all of the N student (numbered 1 to N ) to stand in a line and asks them to sit down on their knees.\n\nStudents know that Big P is a very cruel and sadistic person and students start to sit down themselves when they see a friend sit down.\n\nHowever, there are always some students who do not follow the trend. Now when Big P sees that happen , he slaps that student and makes him sit down. The same process as above is followed and is stopped when any - one student in the line refuses to sit down by himself.\n\nGiven the students that Big P slaps to make them sit down , you need to tell the total no. of students who sat down in that line.\n\nNote: It is not necessary that if A is friend of B then B is also friend of A.\n\nInput Format :\nFirst Line Contains an integer T denoting no of test cases.  Each test case begins with a line containing three integers N,F,S where N is the number of students in the line. Next F lines have two integers A and B denoting the friendship between the students A and B. Next S lines have one integer \nX denoting the student that was slapped by Big P .\n\nOutput Format:\nFor each test case, output a line containing one integer, the total number of students that sit down in that line.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n3 2 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n3 2 1 4\n1 2 4\n2 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
