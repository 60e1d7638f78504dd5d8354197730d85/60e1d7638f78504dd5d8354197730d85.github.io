{"Q_ID": "1419110020", "S_NAME": "Graphs", "Q_NAME": "Graph Problem 12", "Q_DESC": "Given a tree with N nodes and one integer, a. Each node is numbered from 1 to N. Each node i has an integer, Ai, attached to it. You can perform only one type of operation, i.e. Select a subtree of the given tree which includes the node a.\n\nSelect a non-negative integer kFlip the kth least significant bit of the integers attached to each node in the selected subtree.\n\nNote: A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both nodes and edges as subsets of nodes and edges of T.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of operations that is required to make all the integers attached to the nodes of the given tree equal to 0.\n\nInput format: :\n\nFirst line contains two space separated integers, N and (1<=N<=105), (1<a<N). Next N1 lines contains two space separated integers each, x and y (1<x,y<N), denoting that there is an edge between x and y. Next line contains N space separated integers,  Ai  (0<Ai<109), denoting the integers attached to the nodes.\n\nOutput format: :\n\nPrint the minimum number of operations that is required to make all the integers attached to the nodes of the given tree equal to 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "3 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3 1\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
