And one of his favorite memory is when he found a magical ghost, who promised to fulfill one of Little Jhool's wish.\n\nNow, Little Jhool was a kid back then, and so he failed to understand what all could he have asked for from the ghost. So, he ends up asking him something very simple. (He had the intuition that he'd grow up to be a great Mathematician, and a Ruby programmer, alas!) He asked the ghost the power to join a set of *the letters r, u, b and y * into a real ruby. And the ghost, though surprised, granted Little Jhool his wish...\n\nThough he regrets asking for such a lame wish now, but he can still generate a lot of real jewels when he's given a string. You just need to tell him, given a string, how many rubies can he generate from it?                                               \n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains a number t - denoting the number of test cases.\nThe next line contains a string.                                   \n\nOutput Format:\nPrint the maximum number of ruby(ies) he can generate from the given string.               \n\nConstraints:\n1= t=100\n1= Length of the string= 100", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nrrrruubbbyy\nrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrubrb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "2\nruby\nruubbb\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\nrubyuuuubbyyyyburybur\nruubbbyyyyyyuruby\nrubyrubyruby\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "4\nrubyuuuubbyyyyburybu\nruubbbyyyyyyuruby\nrubyrubyruby\nrrrrrrrrrrrrrruby\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2\n3\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
