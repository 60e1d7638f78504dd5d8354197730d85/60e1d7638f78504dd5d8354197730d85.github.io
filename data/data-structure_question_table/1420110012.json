(The legend says because Raichu is ugly, and Pikachu looks good!)\n\nThe question is how do we find these special Pikachus who hate evolution? The crazy Poke'mon trainer Ash Catch'Em has derived a random algorithm, which is completely wrong, but since he's your friend, you've to humor him and his crazy algorithms.\n\nHe thinks if you are given N Pikachus in an array, A1,A2 ... AN, where each Pikachu is denoted by an integer. The total number of unique pairs (Ai,Aj) where i < j is the number of Pikachus who hate evolution.\n\nInput format:\nThe first line will consist of a single integer N. The second line consists of N integers A1,A2 ... AN.\n\nOutput format:\nOutput the total number of unique pairs (Ai,Aj) that can be formed, which will also be the number of special Pikachus.\n\nConstraints:\n1<= N<=  2 * 105\n1<=  Ai<=  109", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 2 1 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "7\n1 2 3 7 5 9 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n21", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n12 3 7 5 9 6 13 10 19 11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n45", "TESTCASE_4": "12\n12 3 7 50 70 79 77 13 10 19 99 101\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n66", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
