But, as they grew up Bob started behaving weird and this used to irritate Alice. Once, while Alice took a break after typing a large program Bob came from nowhere and swapped some alphabet keys on Alice's keyboard.\n\nAlice got very angry on seeing this and decided to end their friendship once forever. As we all know Bob is very good at heart and never does anything wrong intentionally. He decided to type the remaining program with the same keyboard Configuration. Given the original fragment of the code that Bob needs to type, You need to tell Bob the code that he should type to get the original code as output.\n\nHelp him save his friendship with Alice.\n\nINPUT :\n\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of swaps done by Bob. Next N lines contain a pair of characters A,B denoting the characters which are swapped by Bob (Note that he performs these swaps in the given order). From the very next line of input the remaining fragment of the code starts and ends with an end of file character.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nprint the fragment of the program that Bob types.\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n1 = N = 106\n1 = |length of codefragment| = 106\nNOTE:code fragments contain UPPERCASE english alphabets only.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nC R\nP H\nComputerPhile\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nRomhutecHpile", "TESTCASE_2": "1\nW T\nTINWER\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nWINTER", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
