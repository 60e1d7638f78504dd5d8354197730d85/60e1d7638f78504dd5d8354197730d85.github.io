{"Q_ID": "1420110017", "S_NAME": "Hashing", "Q_NAME": "Game of Bots", "Q_DESC": "There are two kind of bots in the game BOT A and BOT B. Both are designed so as to move only in one direction in a 1-D array. Bot A can move towards left whereas bot B is constrained to move rightwards. Both are constrained to move only to the empty elements and one cannot jump over another bot. Now, a particular state of array can be represented with a string of A,B and # where  A/B represents that BOT of kind A/B is sitting there and # represents an empty space.\n\nFor example: AA###B, represents an arena of length 5, where A sits at first two places, then three empty places and bot of kind B at last place. Here, B can be atmost 3 positions leftwards and that too when both A do not move.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer which is the number of test cases, then, t lines follow where each line contains two strings initial and final. where both strings consists of A,B and # representing a particular state. NOTE: initial and final string will be of same length\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print Yes if it is possible to move from initial state to final state else No.\n\nconstraints:\n\n1=t=1000\n\n1=lengthofstring=106 \n\nTotal number of characters does not exceed107", "TESTCASE_1": "1\nA##A#B ##AAB#\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "1\nAB##A# BA###A\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
