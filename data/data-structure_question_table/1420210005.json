If it is a normal room he will keep on moving to other rooms but if he finds an exit room then he would reach out of the villa. Your task is to help Rahul in finding the last room which he can reach.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains a integer T i.e. the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers N, M and K   the number of doors, the number of exit doors in the room, and the number of operations, respectively. The second line of each test case contains M distinct integers h1, h2 , . . . , hm  the positions where there is a exit door. The third line of each test case contains K paired integers  which shows his movement from room Ai.first to room Ai.second or Ai.second room to room Ai.first. \n\nOutput:\nFor each test case in a new line print one integer denoting the room number outside which Rahul is standing.\n\nConstraints:\n1 =T =100\n2 =N =1000\n1=M =N\n1 =K =1000", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 1 2\n2\n1 2 2 4\n7 3 4\n3 4 6\n1 2 2 5 5 7 7 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4 3 4\n7 3 1\n3 2 9 5 7 10 1 8 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4 3 4\n7 3 11\n3 2 2 5 7 1 10 11\n9 1 3\n2\n1 2 3 4 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n4 1 4\n2\n3 2 1 5 10 4 9 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
