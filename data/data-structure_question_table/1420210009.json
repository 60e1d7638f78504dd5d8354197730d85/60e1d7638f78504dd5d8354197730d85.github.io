The main strength of the students of \nA\nB\nC\nABC is their unity. The students of\nX\nY\nZ\nXYZ decide to destroy this unity. The geeks of \nX\nY\nZ\nXYZ prepared a special kind of perfume. Anyone who inhales this perfume becomes extremely violent. The students of \nX\nY\nZ\nXYZ somehow manage to spread this perfume throughout \nA\nB\nC\nABC's campus atmosphere.\n\nThere are \nN\nN boys \n(\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nN\n)\n(1,2,3,.....N) and \nN\nN girls \n(\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nN\n)\n(1,2,3,.....N) in \nA\nB\nC\nABC college. Each boy has a crush on a single girl and each girl has a crush on a single boy. Since the perfume has been inhaled by each and every student of \nA\nB\nC\nABC college, every student decides to beat up his/her crush's crush, ie. , if boy \nx\nx has a crush on girl \ny\ny and girl \ny\ny has a crush on boy \nz\nz, \nx\nx will beat \nz\nz up, provided, of course, if \nx\nx and \nz\nz is not the same person.\n\nThe doctor of \nA\nB\nC\nABC college foresees this situation. He cannot stop so many people from beating each other up, however, he can be prepared for the worst-case patient(s). The worst-case patient(s) will be the patient(s) who get(s) beaten up by the maximum number of students. The doctor comes to you for help. He has \n2\n2 questions for you :\n\n1\n1. What is the number of beatings received by the worst-case patient(s) ?\n\n2\n2. What is the total number of pairs of students who ended up beating up each other ?\n\nInput :\n\nThe first line comprises of \nT\nT, the number of test cases. Each test case comprises of \n3\n3 lines. The first line consists of \nN\nN.\n\nThe next line consists of \nN\nN space separated natural numbers between \n1\n1 and \nN\nN inclusive such that the \ni\nt\nh\nith number denotes the the crush of boy \ni\ni.\n\nThe next line consists of \nN\nN space separated natural numbers between \n1\n1 and \nN\nN inclusive such that the \ni\nt\nh\nith number denotes the the crush of girl \ni\ni.\n\nOutput :\n\nFor every test case, on a new line, print two space separated integers, the answer to doctor's question \n1\n1 followed by answer to doctor's question \n2\n2.\n\nConstraints :\n\n1\n\nT\n\n10\n1T10\n1\n\nN\n\n10\n5", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n3\n2 2 1\n3 2 1\n4\n2 3 4 1\n2 3 4 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0\n1 4", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n2\n1 1 \n1 2\n3\n1 2 1\n1 2 2\n4\n1 2 3 1\n1 2 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 4 3 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 4\n1 4", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n2\n21 12\n12 21\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2 0\n0 0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
