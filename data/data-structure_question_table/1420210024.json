But, there is another Alex D who hates this habit of Alex A and thinks it's risky.\n\nTo test Alex A, Alex D provided him tasks for N days in the form of an array Array, where the elements of the array represent the number of tasks.\n\nThe number of tasks performed by Alex A on the ith day is the number of ones in the binary representation of Arrayi.\n\nAlex A is fed up of Alex D, so to irritate him even more, he decides to print the tasks provided in non-decreasing order of the tasks performed by him on each day. Help him out!\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, where T is the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains N, where N is the number of days.\nThe second line of each test case contains Array array having N elements, where Arrayi represents the number of tasks provided by Alex D to Alex A on ith day.\n\nOutput:\nPrint all the tasks provided to Alex A in the non-decreasing order of number of tasks performed by him.\n\nConstraints:\n1 = T = 100\n1 = N = 105\n1 = Arrayi = 1018\n\nNote:\nIf two numbers have the same number of ones (set bits), print the one which came first in the input first, and then the other one, as in the input.", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n4\n3 4 7 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4 3 10 7", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
