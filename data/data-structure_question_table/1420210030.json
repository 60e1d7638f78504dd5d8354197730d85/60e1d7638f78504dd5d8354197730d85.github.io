Now Figo believes that the scribbled figure is more mysterious than it originally looks, so he also decides to find every occurrence of all the permutations of the scribbled text on the entire rock. Since this is a huge task,needs your help, he needs you to only figure out if any permutation of the scribbled text exists in the given text string, so he can save time and analyze only those text strings where a valid permutation is present.\nInput:\nFirst line contains number of test cases T.Each test case contains two lines ,first line contains pattern and next line contains a text string. All characters in both the strings are in lowercase only [a-z].\nOutput:\nFor each test case print YES or NO (quotes for clarity) depending on whether any permutation of the pattern exists in the text string.\n\nConstraints:\n1  T  100\n1  |Pattern|  1000\n1  |Text String|  100000", "TESTCASE_1": "3\nhack\nindiahacks\ncode\neddy\ncoder\niamredoc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "1\ncollide\ncolleges\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
