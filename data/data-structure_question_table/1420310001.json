{"Q_ID": "1420310001", "S_NAME": "Hashing", "Q_NAME": "Shantam and Richness", "Q_DESC": "Shantam is very rich , even richer than Richie Rich. He is extremely talented in almost everything except one , mathematics. So one day, he pays a visit to a temple (to pray for his upcoming mathematics exams) and decides to donate some amount of money to the poor people ( everyone is poor on a relative scale to Shantam). He order N people to sit in a linear arrangement and indexes them from 1 to N , to ease the process of donating money.\n\nAs with all rich people , their way of doing things is completely eerie and different. Shantam donates his money in M steps , each of his step being to choose two indices L and R , and an amount of money C and then he donates C currencies to each and every person whose index lies in [L,R]. In other words he donates C currencies to every index i such L = i = R.\n\nLuckily, you too were among the N people selected and somehow you know all the M steps in advance. Figure out the maximum amount of money you can obtain and at what position you should sit to get this maximum amount of money. If multiple positions guarantee the maximum amount of money , output the minimum index out of all these possibilities.\n\nYou will be given initial L , R and C (which points to first query) as well as P , Q and S. Each subsequent query is generated as :\n\nL[i] = (L[i-1] * P + R[i-1]) % N + 1;\nR[i] = (R[i-1] * Q + L[i-1]) % N + 1;\nif(L[i]  R[i])\n    swap(L[i] , R[i]);\nC[i] = (C[i-1] * S) % 1000000 + 1;\nInput Format :\n\nThe first line contains T , the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M , which denotes the number of people and the number of steps, respectively. The next line contains integers L , R , C , P , Q and S , which are used to generate the queries using the method specified above.\n\nOutput Format :\n\nFor each test case , output one line containing two space separated integers, the first being the optimal position and the second being the highest amount of money that can be obtained.\n\nConstraints :\n\n1 = T = 200\n\n1 = N = 10^5\n\n1 = M = 10^5\n\n1 = L = R = N\n\n1 = C = 10^6\n\n1 = P,Q,S = 10^4", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n5 1\n1 3 2 4 3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 2\n1 2", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n6 7 \n1 2 4 1 2 1\n5 4\n1 3 5 6 1 4\n3 1\n2 1 1 1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4 29\n3 346\n0 0", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4 5\n1 2 4 1 2 1\n6 4\n3 2 14 1  2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2 24\n3 207", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n4 7\n1 4 5 4 1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 649", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
