His magical powers are faster than a super computer even. So, to prove his worth, he's given a string and he has to answer multiple queries based on the string.\n\nEvery query will have four integers - L1, R1, L2, R2. The first two integers denoting String [ L1, R1 ] (including both L1 and R1) denoting the first substring, the next two integers denoting the second substring String [ L2, R2 ] (including both L2 and R2).\n\nFor every query, you've to answer in Yes or No whether the two substrings are equal or not. Easy enough?\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains a string, S.\nThen, an integer Q denoting the number of queries in the next line.\nThen, for every query, there will be 4 integers L1 R1 L2 R2, denoting the substring S[L1 R1] and S[L2 R2].\n\nOutput:\nFor each query output Yes if the two substrings are same , else output No.\n\nConstraints:\n1  |S|  105\n1  Q  105\n1  L1  R1  |S|\n1  L2  R2  |S|\nThe string will contain only lowercase letters.", "TESTCASE_1": "AlexandhisAlexiness\n4\n1 1 3 3\n1 4 11 14\n3 3 6 6\n4 5 14 17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
