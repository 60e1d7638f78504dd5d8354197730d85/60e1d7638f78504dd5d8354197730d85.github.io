But, he ends up having some misunderstanding with him a lot of times, because Jade's English isn't perfect, and Bonk sucks at the language Jade speaks. So, he's in a fix - since he knows that Jade has got magical powers, he asks him to help so as to clear all the issues they end up having with their friendship.\n\nNow, Jade can only focus at one task, so to fix these language issues he comes up with a magical way out, but someone needs to do the rest of it; this is where Bonk has asked for your help.\n\nBonk says a word, and then Jade says another word.
