(This is essentially the definition of the / and % operators for integers.) Write a program that asks the user how many eggs she has and then tells the user how many dozen eggs she has and how many extra eggs are left over.\n\nA gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so that it will tell the user how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs she has. For example, if the user says that she has 1342 eggs, then your program would respond with Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10\n\nsince 1342 is equal to 9*144 + 3*12 + 10.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "172\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYour number of eggs is=4\ngross=1\ndozen=2", "TESTCASE_2": "342\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYour number of eggs is=6\ngross=2\ndozen=4", "TESTCASE_3": "1342\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYour number of eggs is=10\ngross=9\ndozen=3", "TESTCASE_4": "144\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYour number of eggs is=0\ngross=1\ndozen=0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
