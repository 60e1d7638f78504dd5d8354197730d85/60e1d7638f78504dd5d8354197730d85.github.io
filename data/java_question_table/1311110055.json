Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside.\n\nIn 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. \n\nThe formula is  twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v^0.16 + 0.4275tav^0.16\n\nwhere ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the speed measured in miles per hour. twc is the wind-chill temperature. \n\nThe formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 F or above 41F.\n\nWrite a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 F and 41F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill temperature.\n\nUse Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16\n\nUse of Data type and String.Format(\"%.2f\", value)", "TESTCASE_1": "48.9\n120.43\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe wind chill index is 34.18", "TESTCASE_2": "51.2\n121.44\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe wind chill index is 37.68", "TESTCASE_3": "76.2\n98\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe wind chill index is 76.49", "TESTCASE_4": "67\n81.7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe wind chill index is 63.00", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
