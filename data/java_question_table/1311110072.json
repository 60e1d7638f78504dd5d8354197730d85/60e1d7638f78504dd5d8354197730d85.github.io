{"Q_ID": "1311110072", "S_NAME": "Input and Output Statemen", "Q_NAME": "Heat Capacity", "Q_DESC": "The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a material by one degree Celsius is the materials specific heat capacity, C. The total amount of energy required to raise m grams of a material by (deltaT) degrees Celsius can be computed using the formula:\nq = mCdeltaT.\n\nWrite a program that reads the mass of some water and the temperature change from the user. Your program should display the total amount of energy that must be added or removed to achieve the desired temperature change.\n\nHint: The specific heat capacity of water is 4.186 J by gC. Becausewater has a density of 1.0 gram per millilitre, you can use grams and millilitres interchangeably in this exercise.\n\nExtend your program so that it also computes the cost of heating the water. Electricity is normally billed using units of kilowatt hours rather than Joules. In this exercise, you should assume that electricity costs 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Use your program to compute the cost of boiling water for a cup of coffee.Hint: You will need to look up the factor for converting between Joules and kilowatt hours to complete the last part of this exercise.", "TESTCASE_1": "15.6\n22.1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe required energy in joules1443.16536\nThe energy requires is0.0035668264822008005", "TESTCASE_2": "19.6\n21.1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe required energy in joules1731.1621600000003\nThe energy requires is0.004278619213304801", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
