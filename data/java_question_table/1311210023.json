The quiz being famous for its difficulty, each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it.\n\nThe game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi  Wi + 1 for some 0  i  N  1 is possible.\nChef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions.\n\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions.\n\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions.\n\nNext line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.\n\nConstraints\n\n1=T=500\n1 =N =1000\n0 =Wi =109", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n5\nABCDE\nEBCDA\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n4\nCHEF\nQUIZ\n4 3 2 1 0\n8\nABBABAAB\nABABABAB\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n30\n4\n100", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n5\nABCDE\nEBCAD\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n4\nCHEF\nQUIZ\n4 3 2 1 0\n8\nABBABBBA\nABAAAAAA\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 50 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n20\n4\n100", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
