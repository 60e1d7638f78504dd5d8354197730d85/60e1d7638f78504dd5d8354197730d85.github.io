Find the elements which have even occurrences in the array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space.\n\nNote: In some array, array contains only odd number then you have to print only a blank new line.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, where N is the size of array.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting array elements.\n\nOutput:\n\nCorresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the elements which have even occurrences in the array.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 = T = 100\n1 =N =200\n1 =A[i] = 63", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n11\n9 12 23 10 12 12 15 23 14 12 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n12 23 15", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n5\n23 12 23 15 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n23 15", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n4\n10 34 10 56\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
