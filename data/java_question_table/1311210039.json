{"Q_ID": "1311210039", "S_NAME": "Input and Output Statemen", "Q_NAME": "Good String", "Q_DESC": "Given a string S of length N, you have to tell whether it is good or not. A good string is one where the distance between every two adjacent character is exactly 1. Here distance is defined by minimum distance between two character when alphabets from a to z are put in cyclic manner. For example distance between a to c is 2 and distance between a to y is also 2. The task is to print YES or NO (without quotes) depending on whether the given string is Good or not.\n\nInput:\nFirst line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases.Then T lines follow. Each line contains a string S.\n\n\nOutput:\nPrint  the answer for each testcase in a separate line.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=T=50\n1=|S|=50\n\nNote: S contains only lowercase alphabetic characters", "TESTCASE_1": "1\nAaa\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "1\ncde\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "1\nccd\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_4": "1\nXYZ\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
