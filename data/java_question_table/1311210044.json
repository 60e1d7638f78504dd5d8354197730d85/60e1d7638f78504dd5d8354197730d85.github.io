Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :\n1. Each student gets one packet.\n2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.\n\nExamples\n\nInput : A[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} \n        m = 5\nOutput: Minimum Difference is 6\nWe may pick 3,4,7,9,9 and the output \nis 9-3 = 6\n\nInput : A[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} \n        m = 3\nOutput: Minimum difference is 2\nWe can pick 2, 3 and 4 and get the minimum\ndifference between maximum and minimum packet\nsizes. ie 4-2 = 2\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the no of packets. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array A[] denoting the values of each packet. The third line of each test case contains an integer m denoting the no of students.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case in a new line print the required answer .\n\nConstraints:\n1 <=T<= 100\n1 <=N<= 100\n1 <=A[]<= 100\n1 <=m <=N\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n8\n3 4 1 9 56 7 9 12\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n7\n7 3 2 4 9 12 56\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
