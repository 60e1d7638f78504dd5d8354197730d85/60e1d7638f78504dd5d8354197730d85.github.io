The assignment requires Alex to find the sum of powers of each digit of a given number, as per the method mentioned below.\nIf the given number is 582109,the sum of powers of digits will be calculated as=\n=(5 raised to the power of 0)+(8 raised to the power of 5)+(2 raised to the power of 8)+(1raised to the power of 2)+(0 raised to the power of 1)+(9 raised to the power of 0)|\ni.e each digit of the number is raised to the power of the next digit on its left-side. Note that the left-most digit has to be raised to the power of 0.  The sum of all of these powers is the expected result to be calculated.\nExample 1:if the given number is 582109, the sum of  power of digits=\n=(5 raised to the power of 0)+(8 raised to the power of 5)+(2 raised to the power of 8)+(1raised to the power of 2)+(0 raised to the power of 1)+(9 raised to the power of 0)|\n=1+32768+256+1+0+1=33027\nExample 2:if the given number is 12345, the sum of  power of digits=\n=(1 raised to the power of 0)+(2 raised to the power of 1)+(3 raised to the power of 2)+(4 raised to the power of 3)+(5 raised to the power of 4)|\n=1+2+9+64+625=701\nExample 3:if the given number is 572, the sum of  power of digits=\n=(5 raised to the power of 0)+(7 raised to the power of 5)+(2 raised to the power of 7)|\n=1+16807+128=16936\nAssumptions:For this assignment let us assume that the given number will always contains more than 1 digit. i.e. the given number will always be9", "TESTCASE_1": "1236\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n228", "TESTCASE_2": "12345\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n701", "TESTCASE_3": "572\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n16936", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
