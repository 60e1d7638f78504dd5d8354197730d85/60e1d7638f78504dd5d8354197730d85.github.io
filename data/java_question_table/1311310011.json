In order to save the time they divided their work.\nSo scientist Mathew worked on a piece and invented a number computed with the following formula:\nA Mathew number is computed as follows using the formula:\nH(n) = n(2n-1)\nAnd scientist John invented another number which is built by the following formula which is called John number.\nT(n) = n(n+1)/2\nNow Mathew and John are jumbled while combining their work. Now help them combine their research work by finding out number in a given range that satisfies both properties. Using the above formula, the first few Mathew-John numbers are:\n1 6 15 28 \nInput Format:\n\nInput consists of 3 integers T1,T2,M separated by space . T1 and T2 are upper and lower limits of the range. The range is inclusive of both T1 and T2. Find Mth number in range [T1,T2] which is actually a Mathew-John number.\n\nLine 1 T1 T2 M,where T1 is upper limit of the range, T2 is lower limit of the range and M ,where Mth element of the series is required\n\nConstraints:\n\n0  T1  T2  1000000\n\nOutput Format:\n\nPrint Mth number from formed sequence between T1 and T2(inclusive).", "TESTCASE_1": "90 150 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n120", "TESTCASE_2": "20 80 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo number is present at this index", "TESTCASE_3": "15 16 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo number is present at this index", "TESTCASE_4": "1145 2894 350\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo number is present at this index", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
