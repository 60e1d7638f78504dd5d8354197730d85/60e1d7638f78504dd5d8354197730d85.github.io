{"Q_ID": "1311310020", "S_NAME": "Input and Output Statemen", "Q_NAME": "Number Isomorphism", "Q_DESC": "Let's call two numbers isomorphic if they have same number of digits and set of places having equal digits is same. We consider that all the numbers are in decimal notation and don't have leading zeroes. Consider some examples:\n\n12321 is isomorphic to 83538 and 45654.\n1232 is not isomorphically equal to 2342 because set of places having equal digits are {{1}, {2, 4}, {3}} and {{1, 4}, {2}, {3}} (digits are numbered from left to right using 1 based indexing). In other words, the digits order has to remain the same.\n12 isomorphic to 10,13,14, 92, but not isomorphic to 1, because their lengths are not equal and not isomorphic to 01, because leading zeroes are not allowed.\nLet F(X) denote the smallest integer (without leading zeroes) isomorphic to X where X is a positive integer. For example, F(12) = 10, F(213) = 102.\n\nYou are given two integers N and M. Your task is to calculate F(1) % M + F(2) % M + F(3) % M + ... + F(N - 1) % M + F(N) % M.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a pair of integers N and M. The meaning of these integers is described in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1  T  10\n1  N  1011\n1  M  107", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n15 100\n123456789 9876543\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n70\n102768568246676", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
