{"Q_ID": "1311310023", "S_NAME": "Input and Output Statemen", "Q_NAME": "The New Restaurant", "Q_DESC": "Chef decided to open a new restaurant in the town. The town already has N restaurants, each of which operates in an area of circular shape with its center at xi, yi and radius ri. For any point, there is at most one restaurant operating there.\n\nChef wants to build his restaurant in a strategic place. That's why he asks you some questions - find the total area covered by restaurants in the rectangle defined by the points x1, y1, x2, y2 where (x1, y1) is the lower left corner and (x2, y2) is the upper right corner. Chef is not that good in answering these questions, so he asked you to help him in this.\n\nInput\n\nThere is a single test case.\n\nThe first line of input contains two integers N, Q, denoting number of restaurants and number of questions Chef asks.\n\nEach of the next N lines contains three space separated integers x, y, r denoting x and y coordinate of center, and the radius of the restaurant, respectively.\n\nEach of the next Q lines contains four space separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2 denoting a question as defined in the statement.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput Q lines, the i-th line contains the total area covered by restaurants in the rectangle defined by the i-th query. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10-6\n\nConstraints\n\n1  N  50 000\n1  Q  100 000\n0  xi, yi  50 000\n1  ri  50\n0  xi1  xi2  50 000\n0  yi1  yi2  50 000\nNo two circles touch or intersect each other.", "TESTCASE_1": "2 4\n5 5 2\n2 2 1\n2 2 5 5\n1 1 7 7\n2 3 8 4\n1 3 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3.926990816987241\n15.707963267948966\n2.456739397217513\n0.000000000000000", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
