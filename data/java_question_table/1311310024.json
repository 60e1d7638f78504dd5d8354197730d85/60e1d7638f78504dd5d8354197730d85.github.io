{"Q_ID": "1311310024", "S_NAME": "Input and Output Statemen", "Q_NAME": "Tree Labelling", "Q_DESC": "Chef likes to play with trees a lot, so his best friend Smurf has given him a tree T consisting of N nodes numbered from 1 to N.\n\nSmurf asked him to count the number of ways to assign an integer in the range [1, M] to each of the nodes of the tree such that the absolute difference between the integers assigned to any pair of adjacent nodes is greater or equal than K (i. e  K). Since this number can be huge, Chef only needs to find it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)\n\nOf course this task is tough for our little chef and he cannot solve it without your help. Can you help him?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers denoting N, M and K, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the values of M and K respectively.\n\nThe following (N-1) lines of each test case contain two space separated integers u and v denoting that there is an edge between the nodes u and v.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the answer in a separate line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  50\n\n1  N  100\n\n0  K  100\n\n1  M  109", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2 2 0\n1 2\n3 3 2\n1 3\n1 2\n3 3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n2\n12", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
