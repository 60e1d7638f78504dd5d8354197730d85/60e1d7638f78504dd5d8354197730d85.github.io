Otherwise, he believes that the day will be unlucky.\n\nPlease see note section for formal definition of alternating code.\n\nYou are given a ticket code. Please determine, whether the day will be successful for Mike or not. Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S denoting the letter code on the ticket.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" (without quotes) in case the day will be successful and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nNote\nTwo letters x, y where x != y are said to be alternating in a code, if code is of form \"xyxyxy...\".\n\nConstraints\n1<=T <=100\n\nS consists only of upper-case Latin letters\nSubtask 1 (50 points):\n\n|S| = 2\nSubtask 2 (50 points):\n\n2 <= |S| <= 100\n", "TESTCASE_1": "2\nABABAB\nABC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "2\nABC\nXYXYXY\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_3": "4\nChris\nJohn\nABABA\nABCABC\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
