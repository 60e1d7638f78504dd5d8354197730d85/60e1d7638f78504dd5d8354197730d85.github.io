She absolutely loves shiny stones that she can put on as jewellery accessories. \n\nShe has been collecting stones since her childhood - now she has become really good with identifying which ones are fake and which ones are not. Her King requested for her help in mining precious stones, so she has told him which all stones are jewels and which are not. \n\nGiven her description, your task is to count the number of jewel stones. \n\nMore formally, you're given a string J composed of latin characters where each character is a jewel. \n\nYou are also given a string S composed of latin characters where each character is a mined stone. You have to find out how many characters of S are in J as well.\n\nFirst line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThen follow T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, each of which contains a string composed of English lower case and upper characters. \n\nFirst of these is the jewel string J and the second one is stone string S.\nYou can assume that 1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= |J|, |S| <= 100\n\nOutput\nOutput for each test case, a single integer, the number of jewels mined.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\nabc\nabcdef\naA\nabAZ\naaa\na\nwhat\nNone\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "3\nabc\nabcdfd\naA\nasgdgg\na\nwhat\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "5\ndhfkjl\nlaskdvc\nniareuv\nldakjnfkanlc\nlakjsh\nna;sldfonfosd\n;naslkdsn\nnlasd\nnoasd\nfhgj\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n4\n4\n5\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "9\nnviaj\ndknas\nfkasndv\nksdnvids\nodsnv\ndjknds\nldsvn\nlsvn\nasnv\nlnsav\nalnsdk\nvkldanv\nnvkasdv\nvnldksnv\nsvnldshfjk\njhk\njfgh\njfhgj\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n7\n4\n4\n4\n5\n7\n3\n5", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
