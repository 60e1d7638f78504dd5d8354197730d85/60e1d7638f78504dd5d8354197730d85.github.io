For example, the six in sixty has a lower weighting than the six in six hundred. Then in a binary numbering system we need some way of converting Decimal to Binary as well as back from Binary to Decimal.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n100", "TESTCASE_2": "521\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1000001001", "TESTCASE_3": "1024\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10000000000", "TESTCASE_4": "4098\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1000000000010\n", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
