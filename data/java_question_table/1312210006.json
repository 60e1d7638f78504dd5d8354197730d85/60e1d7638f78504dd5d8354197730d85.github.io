Mike still has no answer.\n\nSo, help Mike! There are N members in the SCC, i'th member has Ci stamps in his collection. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of members of SCC.\n\nThe second line contains N integers Ci, denoting the numbers of the stamps in the collection of i'th member.\n\nOutput\n\nThe first line should contain YES, if we can obtain the required division, otherwise NO.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  N  100 000;\n\n1  Ci  109.\n ", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n7 4 1 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n3 0 3 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n1 2 3 4 6 8 4 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
