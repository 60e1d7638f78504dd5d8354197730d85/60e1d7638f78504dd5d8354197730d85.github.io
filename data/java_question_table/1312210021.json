Chef is reading about Relational Operators. \n\nRelational Operators are operators which check relatioship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is, \n\n\n\nFirst one is greater than second or,\nFirst one is less than second or,\nFirst and second one are equal.\n \n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases. Each of the T lines contain two integers A and B.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains any one of the relational operators\n\n'' , '' , '='.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  10000\n1  A, B  1000000001", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n10 20\n20 10\n10 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n\n\n=", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
