This number has such a lot of properties, like:\n\nFour is the smallest composite number;\nIt is also the smallest Smith number;\nThe smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;\nFour is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;\nThere is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;\nLagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;\nFour is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;\nIn bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;\nAnd there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!\nImpressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n447474\n228\n6664\n40\n81\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n1\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
