Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made.\n\nIn order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements.\n\nCould you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed.\n\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the measurements.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the average value after removing K lowest and K greatest measurements.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct, in case it has absolute or relative error, not exceeding 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  100\n1  N  104\n0  2K  N\n-106  Ai  106", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n5 0\n2 9 -10 25 1\n3 1\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4.000000\n5.400000\n1.000000", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
