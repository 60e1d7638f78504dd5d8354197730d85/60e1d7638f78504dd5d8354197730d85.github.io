{"Q_ID": "1312210040", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Buying Sweets", "Q_DESC": "Banknotes in the state of Strangeland don't have any regulated values like 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc. In fact, it's possible to see any positive integer on a banknote of Strangeland. Indeed, this isn't the most convenient thing.\n\nAnn is working as a sweet seller at a shop in Strangeland. Every kind of sweets in this shop has its own cost, and sweets of the same kind have the same cost.\n\nCustomers in Strangeland are strange. A customer points at some kind of sweets and gives several banknotes to the seller. This means that he wants to buy a positive number of sweets of that kind. He doesn't tell the exact number of sweets he wants to buy. The only thing Ann knows is: an 'adequate' customer won't give any extra banknotes. It means that if you throw away any banknote, the resulting amount of money won't be enough to buy the wanted number of sweets.\n\nAnn has to determine the number of sweets the customer wants. Help Ann write a program which determines this number or tells that it's impossible.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n4 7\n10 4 8 5\n1 10\n12\n2 10\n20 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n1\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n4 7\n10 4 5 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
