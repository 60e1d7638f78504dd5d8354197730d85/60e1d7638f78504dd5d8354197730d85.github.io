{"Q_ID": "1312210041", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Subtraction Game 1", "Q_DESC": "Chef is playing a game on a sequence of N positive integers, say A1, A2, ... AN. The game is played as follows.\n\nIf all the numbers are equal, the game ends.\nOtherwise\nSelect two numbers which are unequal\nSubtract the smaller number from the larger number\nReplace the larger number with the result from above (see the explanation section for clarity)\nChef has already figured out that the game always terminates. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the same value, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him on which value will the game terminate for a given sequence of integers.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of T test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the length of the sequence. The second line contains N positive integers, each separated by a single space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer - the value of all the numbers when they are equal (and the game terminates), on a line by itself.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  100\n1  N  1000\n1  Ai  109", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2\n10 12\n2\n5 9\n3\n6 10 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
