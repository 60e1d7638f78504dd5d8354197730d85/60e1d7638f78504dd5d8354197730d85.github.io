{"Q_ID": "1312310007", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "No Unpaired Chefs ", "Q_DESC": "Codechef has now decided to make an admin panel amongst their chefs. This way they think that it would be easier for them to control and regulate their contests. To do so, they have asked them to rate everyone including themselves by a non-negative integer.\n\nThere are N chefs, numbered from 1 to N. Each chef has submitted a rating to the Codechef panel for other all the chefs including a rating to himself. Surprisingly for the team, for each pair of chefs (say, chef with the number i and the chef with the number j), they collaborated within themselves and gave the same rating to each other i.e. the rating that the chef i has given to the chef j is equal to the rating that the chef j has given to the chef i. The Codechef team built a rating matrix from this input from Chefs. Now, from this input rating matrix M, they will make a Paired rating matrix P as follows:\n\nP is symmetric.\nPi, j is either equal to zero, or to Mi, j, where Mi, j is the rating given by ith chef to the jth chef.\nThere exists S > 0, such that each entry in P + P2 + ... + PS is positive.\nTo make things more friendly between the admin panel of Chefs, the sum of values in P is minimum possible.\nHelp the Codechef panel in selecting such a matrix P from M. Please find the minimum possible sum of entries in the matrix P such that P will still satisfy the constraints.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains T, number of test cases to follow. Then T test cases follow.\n\nEach test case start with a line containing an integer N, the number of chefs in Codechef team.\n\nThen N lines follow. Each of them contains N space-separated integers. The jth integer in the ith line is the rating given by chef with the number i to chef with the number j.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the minimum sum of entries, possible for P. If it is not possible to do, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  100\nConstraints on N:\nSubproblem 1 (30 points): 1  N  5\nSubproblem 2 (70 points): 1  N  100\n0  Mi, j  109", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n1 0\n0 1\n2\n1 1\n1 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1                           2", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n2\n2 5\n0 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2\n2 5\n0 2\n3\n1 0 2\n2 0 3\n4 6 0\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n\n10", "TESTCASE_4": "03\n3\n3 0 5\n1 2 6\n5 6 8\n4\n1 0 3 3\n2 0 2 8\n0 0 7 8\n2 2 5 3\n2\n2 3\n4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n22\n\n16\n\n6\n", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
