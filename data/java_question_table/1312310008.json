{"Q_ID": "1312310008", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Tasty Dishes", "Q_DESC": "Chef's restaurant is the most attractive place to have dinner at. To understand why, let's have a look at a way customers do their orders:\n\nThere is only one list of N ingredients in the menu. Every ingredient has its beauty value that does not depend on its taste, but on the way it looks, which is expressed as a positive integer. To order a dish, the customer asks Chef to use all the ingredients from L to R (L is strictly less than R). Chef knows that the dish will be tasty and not only beautiful if the sum of its ingredients' beauty values is divisible by K. Chef does not want to use all the ingredients, so he always excludes one of them. Which one? - The least beautiful one! (in other words - which has the minimal beauty value). Now he wonders - how many segments (L,R) are there such that the sum of their beauty values will be divisible by K after excluding the least beautiful ingredient.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line of the input consists of two positive integers - N and K. There are N space separated positive integers - beauty values of the ingredients.\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput should consist of a single integer - the answer for the problem\n\nConstraints:\n\n1  N  2*105\n1  K  109\n1  beauty value  109\n", "TESTCASE_1": "4 2\n1 2 3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "5 3\n2 2 7 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "6 4\n4 6 7 8 9 0 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "2 6\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
