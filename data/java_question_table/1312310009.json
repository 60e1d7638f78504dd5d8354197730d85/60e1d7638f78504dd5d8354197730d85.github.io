Chef and Churu are very fast friends, they share their knowledge whenever they meet. Chef use to give a lot of exercises after he teaches some concept to Churu.\n\nChef has an array of N numbers. He also has N functions. Each function will return the sum of all numbers in the array from Li to Ri. So Chef asks churu a lot of queries which are of two types.\nType 1: Change the xth element of the array to y. \nType 2: Return the sum of all functions from m to n.\n\nNow Churu has started to solve, but Chef realize that it is tough for him to decide whether Churu is correct or not. So he needs your help , will you help him out ?\nInput Format\n\nFirst Line is the size of the array i.e. N \nNext Line contains N space separated numbers Ai denoting the array\nNext N line follows denoting Li and Ri for each functions.\nNext Line contains an integer Q , number of queries to follow.\nNext Q line follows , each line containing a query of Type 1 or Type 2.\n1 x y : denotes a type 1 query,where x and y are integers\n2 m n : denotes a type 2 query where m and n are integers\nOutput Format\n\nFor each query of type 2 , output as asked above.\nConstraints\n\n1  N  105\n1  Ai  109\n1  Li  N\nLi  Ri  N\n1  Q  105\n1  x  N\n1  y  109\n1  m  N\nm  n  N\nSubtask\n\nSubtask 1: N  1000 , Q  1000 , 10 points\nSubtask 2: R-L  10 , all x will be distinct ,10 points\nSubtask 3: Refer to constraints above , 80 points", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 3\n2 5\n4 5\n3 5\n1 2\n4\n2 1 4\n1 3 7\n2 1 4\n2 3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n41\n53\n28", "TESTCASE_2": "6 \n1 2 3 4 5 6\n2 5\n2 6\n5 6\n3 6\n5 6\n2 6\n4\n1 1 3\n2 2 5\n1 4 7\n2 4 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n60\n\n55\n", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 5\n2 5\n1\n2 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_4": "3\n1 2 3 \n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n2\n2 2 2\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
