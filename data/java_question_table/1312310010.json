{"Q_ID": "1312310010", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Integer Sequences", "Q_DESC": "For a fixed integer n, let x1, x2, ..., x2n be a sequence that contains each of the 2n different n bit integers exactly once. To be precise, we say an integer is an n bit integer if it can be expressed in binary with exactly n bits (with, perhaps, some leading zeros). We say the sequence is gradual if two consecutive numbers differ in exactly one bit when written in binary and the first and last numbers also differ in exactly one bit in their binary representations.\n\nYour job is to generate such a sequence. This is normally a fairly standard exercise, but there is one extra constraint. For some reason, there are two particular n bit numbers a and b such that it is illegal to have a and b appear consecutively (in either order) in the sequence and it is illegal to have one of a or b at the start of the sequence and the other at the end.\n\nFor example, if n = 2, a = 1, and b = 3 then the sequence 0, 2, 3, 1 is not allowed since a and b are consecutive. The sequence 1, 0, 2, 3 is also not allowed since a is at the beginning and b is at the end. Finally, the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3 is also not allowed since two bits change when going from 1 to 2 and when going from 3 to 0.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer t  30 denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of three numbers n, a, b. Here, n is the number of bits (between 1 and 15, inclusive) and a and b are distinct integers between 0 and 2n-1 (inclusive).\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case is a single line consisting of a sequence of 2n integers. This should be such that the sequence is gradual according to the above description and contains all n bit integers. Furthermore, numbers a and b should not appear consecutively (in either order) nor does the start of the sequence contain one of a or b and the end contain the other. If there are many such sequences then any will do. On the other hand, if there is no such sequence then simply print a single line containing -1.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n2 0 1\n3 1 2\n3 5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n -1\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4\n1 3 7 6 2 0 4 5", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n7 0 9\n3 7 3\n8 5 8\n4 7 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8 24 25 27 26 30 31 29 28 20 21 23 22 18 19 17 16 48 49 51 50 54 55 53 52 60 61 63 62 58 59 57 56 40 41 43 42 46 47 45 44 36 37 39 38 34 35 33 32 96 97 99 98 102 103 101 100 108 109 111 110 106 107 105 104 120 121 123 122 126 127 125 124 116 117 119 118 114 115 113 112 80 81 83 82 86 87 85 84 92 93 95 94 90 91 89 88 72 73 75 74 78 79 77 76 68 69 71 70 66 67 65 64\n\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4\n\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8 24 25 27 26 30 31 29 28 20 21 23 22 18 19 17 16 48 49 51 50 54 55 53 52 60 61 63 62 58 59 57 56 40 41 43 42 46 47 45 44 36 37 39 38 34 35 33 32 96 97 99 98 102 103 101 100 108 109 111 110 106 107 105 104 120 121 123 122 126 127 125 124 116 117 119 118 114 115 113 112 80 81 83 82 86 87 85 84 92 93 95 94 90 91 89 88 72 73 75 74 78 79 77 76 68 69 71 70 66 67 65 64 192 193 195 194 198 199 197 196 204 205 207 206 202 203 201 200 216 217 219 218 222 223 221 220 212 213 215 214 210 211 209 208 240 241 243 242 246 247 245 244 252 253 255 254 250 251 249 248 232 233 235 234 238 239 237 236 228 229 231 230 226 227 225 224 160 161 163 162 166 167 165 164 172 173 175 174 170 171 169 168 184 185 187 186 190 191 189 188 180 181 183 182 178 179 177 176 144 145 147 146 150 151 149 148 156 157 159 158 154 155 153 152 136 137 139 138 142 143 141 140 132 133 135 134 130 131 129 128\n\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8\n\n", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 1 2\n1 3 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0 1 3 2\n\n-1", "TESTCASE_4": "3\n1 2 3\n4 1 6\n2 3 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8\n\n0 1 3 2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
