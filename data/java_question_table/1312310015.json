Each cell of the grid has to be colored with exactly one color. A coloring of the grid is\nconsidered beautiful if no two cells of the same row or same column have the same color.\n\nThe cells of first two rows are already colored and they dont violate the beautiful condition (one color doesnt appear more than once on the same row or on the same column).\n\nFind how many different ways he can color the 3rd row such that the resulting grid is beautiful. Two ways of coloring are considered different if there is at least one cell which is colored with different color.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test\ncase contains an integer N.\nThe next line contains N integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai(1  i  N) is the color of the cell at column i of 1st row.\nThe next line contains N integers B1, B2, ..., BN, where Bi(1  i  N) is the color of the cell at column i of 2nd row.\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the number of ways to color the 3rd row such that the resulting grid is beautiful. Output the result modulo 1000000007.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  20\n3  N  1000\nA1, A2, ..., AN is a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., N.\nB1, B2, ..., BN is a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., N.\nAi  Bi ( 1  i  N)", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4\n2 1 4 3\n4 2 3 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n4\n2 1 4 3\n4 2 3 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n4\n1 1 2 3\n3 1 1 2\n4\n1 1 1 1\n1 3 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n4\n1 1 2 3\n3 1 1 2\n4\n1 2 1 1\n2 1 2 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n4\n3 3 2 3\n3 2 1 2\n4\n2 2 2 3\n2 2 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n4", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
