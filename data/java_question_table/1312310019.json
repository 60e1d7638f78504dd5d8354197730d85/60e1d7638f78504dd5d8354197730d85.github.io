{"Q_ID": "1312310019", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Box and Ball System ", "Q_DESC": "Chef Ciel has forgotten the combination to the safe. It's a serious incident, because the safe contains this month's waitstaff salaries.\n\nTo open the safe, N boxes and N balls are used. The safe has N boxes that numbered from 1 to N uniquely. Each box can contain only one ball. Now, the box i contains one ball that numbered i, and the safe is locked.\n\nThe only things which Ciel remember for unlocking the safe are the followings:\n\nShe must put every ball into some box.\nLet the box i contains the ball Ai. When the safe is opened the number of divisors of i equals to the number of divisors of Ai for all i from 1 to N.\nHow many combinations which satisfy above conditions should she check? The number of combinations can be very large, so you should print this number modulo 500009 (5*105+9).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains an integer N.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the number of combinations modulo 500009 (5*105+9).\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  100000 (105)\n3  N  2000000000 (2*109)", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n5\n100\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n5\n43264", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n3 \n56\n2 \n89\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n\n439228\n\n0\n\n374864", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n34\n99\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n75965\n\n271636\n", "TESTCASE_4": "3\n23\n10\n259\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n87362\n\n287\n\n448032", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
