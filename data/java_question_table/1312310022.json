{"Q_ID": "1312310022", "S_NAME": "Data types and Operators", "Q_NAME": "Sereja and Stones ", "Q_DESC": "Sereja has N boxes and M stones. There is a parameter energy associated with each empty box, denoted by Ei. He wants to move each stone into some box. After moving all the stones into the boxes, he wants to compute the total energy of box/stone system. For that he believes that a contribution of box into energy of the system can be computed as follows. If box i contains s stones and there are total k boxes out there containing more than s stones, then contribution of box i into the system of energy will be given by Ei  k.\n\nSereja wants the box/stone system to be most stable, i.e. it should have least possible energy. Find out minimum possible energy of this system.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T tests follow.\n\nFirst line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M.\n\nNext line contains N space separated integers denoting the array E.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  7\n7  N, M  77777", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2 4\n7 8\n4 6\n7 7 10 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n21", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2 4\n7 8\n4 6\n7 7 1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "2\n2 1\n7 7\n4 2\n0 1 1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "2\n1 3\n7 4\n4 0\n0 1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
