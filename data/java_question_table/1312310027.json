Each vertex has a positive integer written on it, number on the ith vertex being vi. Your program must process two types of queries :\n\n1. Find query represented by F u v : Find out gcd of all numbers on the unique path between vertices u and v in the tree (both inclusive).\n\n2. Change query represented by C u v d : Add d to the number written on all vertices along the unique path between vertices u and v in the tree (both inclusive).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the vertex set of the tree. Then follow N - 1 lines, ith of which contains two integers ai and bi denoting an edge between vertices ai and bi in the tree. After this follow N space separated integers in a single line denoting initial values vi at each of these nodes. Then follows a single integer Q on a line by itself, denoting the number of queries to follow. Then follow Q queries, each one on a line by itself. Each query is either a find query or a change query with format as given in problem statement. Note that all vertices are 0-based.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every find query, print the answer to that query in one line by itself.", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n0 4\n0 5\n1 5\n5 2\n3 5\n3 1 3 2 4 2\n5\nF 3 5\nC 1 3 1\nC 3 4 4\nF 3 0\nF 2 5\n0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n7\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n0 4\n0 5\n1 5\n5 2\n3 5\n3 1 3 2 4 2\n5\nF 3 3\nC 1 2 1\nC 3 4 4\nF 3 0\nF 2 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n1\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n1 4\n5 1\n1 5\n2 3\n3 5\n3 1 3 2 4 2\n5\nF 3 3\nC 1 2 4\nF 3 4 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n6\n6", "TESTCASE_4": "6\n1 4\n5 1\n1 5\n2 3\n3 5\n3 1 3 2 4 2\n5\nF 3 3\nF 1 2 4\nF 3 4 3\nF 3 1\nF 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
