For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.\n\nThe greatest common divisor is also known as the greatest common factor (gcf), highest common factor (hcf),  greatest common measure (gcm), or highest common divisor.\n\nThis notion can be extended to polynomials (see Polynomial greatest common divisor) and other commutative rings ", "TESTCASE_1": "8 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "8 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "36 42\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_4": "112 58\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
