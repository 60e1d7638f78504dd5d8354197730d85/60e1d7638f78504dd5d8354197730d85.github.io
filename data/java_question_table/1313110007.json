This dimension becomes 1 while the sizes of all other dimensions remain the same.\n\nGet  array as input and display the sum of array elements as outputs\n\nFirst line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. \n\nThen follow T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, each of which contains a string composed of English lower case and upper characters. \n\nFirst of these is the jewel string J and the second one is stone string S. \n\nYou can assume that 1 = T = 100, 1 = |J|, |S| = 100", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n1 2 3 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n100", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n70 70 70 70 70 70 70\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n490", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
