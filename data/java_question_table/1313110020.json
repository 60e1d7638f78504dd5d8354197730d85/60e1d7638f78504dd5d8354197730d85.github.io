{"Q_ID": "1313110020", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Magician Numbers", "Q_DESC": "This problem practices the addition of 2-digit numbers. Encourage the students to share the methods that they use to solve the problem. For example some students may use place value while others will find it easier to use a rounding method.\n91 + 19   \n\nplace value: 91 + 9 + 10\nrounding: 91 + 20  1\n\nThis problem also offers the opportunity for students to play with numbers. As well as practising addition the students are encouraged to look for patterns in their answers. This play encourages students to increase their understanding of numbers and how they relate to one another.  It also helps develop problem solving skill and creativity.\n\nAs numbers are 'reversed' they swap places. (eg. 41 to 14) It is therefore important to discuss what is happening to the place value of the numbers.\n\nIf an Integer N, write a program to reverse the given number.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.\n\nOutput\nDisplay the reverse of the given number N\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n12345\n2512\n9009\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n54321\n2152\n9009", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n31203\n71092\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n30213\n29017", "TESTCASE_3": "4\n2123\n25\n201\n901\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3212\n52\n102\n109", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n91631\n62534\n937218\n3572\n8744\n111111\n9833\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n13619\n43526\n812739\n2753\n4478\n111111\n3389", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
