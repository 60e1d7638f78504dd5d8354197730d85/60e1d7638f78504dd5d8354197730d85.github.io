{"Q_ID": "1313110023", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Lisa Workbook", "Q_DESC": "Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.\n\n1. There are  n chapters in Lisas workbook, numbered from  1 to n\n\n\n2. The ith chapter t subscript i has  problems, numbered from  1 to t subscript i\n\n3. Each page can hold up to  k problems. There are no empty pages or unnecessary spaces, so only the last page of a chapter may contain fewer than k problems.\n\n4. Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.\n\n5. The page number indexing starts at 1.\n\n\nLisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's located. Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?\n\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k - the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per page respectively. \n\nThe second line contains  n t1,t2...tn integers , where  t subscript i denotes the number of problems in the ith chapter.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.\n\nSample Input", "TESTCASE_1": "5 3  \n4 2 6 1 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "10 4\n3 6 4 5 2 9 10 8 1 50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "15 40\n81 23 45 19 92 57 32 89 89 54 76 68 36 100 38\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n15", "TESTCASE_4": "12 6 \n2 4 2 8 61 4 2 8 19 24 99 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
