Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:\n\n1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e. Fine = 0)\n\n2. If the book is returned after the expected return day, but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, (Fine = 15 Hackos * Number of Days Late)\n\n3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the (Fine = 500 Hackos * Number of Months Late)\n\n4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of (Fine 10000 Hackos )\n\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was actually returned. \n\nThe second line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective , , and  on which the book was expected to be returned (due date)\n\nConstraints\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input", "TESTCASE_1": "9 6 2015\n6 6 2015\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n45", "TESTCASE_2": "6 7 2015\n6 5 2015\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1000", "TESTCASE_3": "30 7 2019\n30 1 2016\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10000", "TESTCASE_4": "20 12 2004 \n6 1 2004\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5500", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
