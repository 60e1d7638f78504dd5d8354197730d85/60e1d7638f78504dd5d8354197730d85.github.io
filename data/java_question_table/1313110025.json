{"Q_ID": "1313110025", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Julius Caesar", "Q_DESC": "Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it in a cipher. Caesars cipher rotated every letter in a string by a fixed number,  K, making it unreadable by his enemies. Given a string,  S, and a number, K, encrypt S and print the resulting string.\n\nNote: The cipher only encrypts letters; symbols, such as - remain unencrypted.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer, N , which is the length of the unencrypted string. \n\nThe second line contains the unencrypted string, S. \n\nThe third line contains the integer encryption key, K , which is the number of letters to rotate.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 = N =100\n0=K = 100\n \nS is a valid ASCII string and does not contain any spaces.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print the encoded string.\n\n\nExplanation\n\nEach unencrypted letter is replaced with the letter occurring  K spaces after it when listed alphabetically. Think of the alphabet as being both case-sensitive and circular; if  K rotates past the end of the alphabet, it loops back to the beginning (i.e.: the letter after z is z, and the letter after  is Z is A ).\n\nSelected Examples: \nm (ASCII 109) becomes o (ASCII 111). \n i (ASCII 105) becomes k (ASCII 107). \n - remains the same, as symbols are not encoded. \nO (ASCII 79) becomes Q (ASCII 81). \nz (ASCII 122) becomes b (ASCII 98); because  z is the last letter of the alphabet,  a (ASCII 97) is the next letter after it in lower-case rotation.", "TESTCASE_1": "11\nmiddle-Outz\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nokffng-Qwvb", "TESTCASE_2": "20\nMiserABLE-Mohammed-m\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nRnxjwFGQJ-Rtmfrrji-r", "TESTCASE_3": "10\nABCDEFGHIJ\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFGHIJKLMNO", "TESTCASE_4": "9\ndhahsjaka\n6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\njngnypgqg", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
