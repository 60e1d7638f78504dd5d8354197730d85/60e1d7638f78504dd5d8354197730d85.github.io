{"Q_ID": "1313110026", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Angry Professor", "Q_DESC": "The professor is conducting a course on Discrete Mathematics to a class of N students. He is angry at the lack of their discipline, and he decides to cancel the class if there are fewer than K students present after the class starts.\n\nGiven the arrival time of each student, your task is to find out if the class gets cancelled or not.\n\nINPUT\n\nThe first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, N and K. The next line contains N space-separated integers, a1,a2,,aN, representing the arrival time of each student.\n\nIf the arrival time of a given student is a non-positive integer (ai=0), then the student enters before the class starts. If the arrival time of a given student is a positive integer (ai0), the student enters after the class has started.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nFor each testcase, print YES (without quotes) if the class gets cancelled and NO (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nCONSTRAINT\n\n1=T=10\n\n1=N=1000\n\n1=N=100=ai=100, where i[1,N]\n\nNOTE\n\nIf a student enters the class exactly when it starts (ai=0), the student is considered to have entered before the class has started.\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, K=3, i.e., the professor wants at least 3 students to be in class but there are only 2 who have arrived on time (3 and 1), hence the class gets cancelled.\n\nFor the second test case, K=2, i.e, the professor wants at least 2 students to be in class and there are 2 who have arrived on time (0 and 1), hence the class does not get cancelled.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n4 3\n-1 -3 4 2\n4 2\n0 -1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n5 2\n-1 -2 3 1 3\n4 4\n-1 -2 0 1\n5 5\n1 2 3 0 1\n5 3\n-1 -2 -3 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n6 1\n-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -62\n5 2\n-1 0 2 5 6\n10 5\n-1 -2 -3 -4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "3\n3 1\n-1 2 3\n3 2\n-1 -2 3\n3 3\n-1 -2 -3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nNO\nNO", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
