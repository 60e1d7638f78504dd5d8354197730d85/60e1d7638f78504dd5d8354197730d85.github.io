Each chocolate has a flat cost of c dollars, and the store has a promotion where they allow you to trade in m chocolate wrappers in exchange for 1 free piece of chocolate.\n\nFor example, if m=2 and Bobby has n=4 dollars that he uses to buy 4 chocolates at c=1 dollar apiece, he can trade in the 4 wrappers to buy 2 more chocolates. Now he has 2 more wrappers that he can trade in for 1 more chocolate. Because he only has 1 wrapper left at this point and 1<m, he was only able to eat a total of 7 pieces of chocolate.\nGiven n,c, and m and  for t trips to the store, can you determine how many chocolates Bobby eats during each trip?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer,t , denoting the number of trips Bobby makes to the store. \nEach line i of the t subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective n,c , and m values for one of Bobby's trips to the store.\nConstraints\n 1<=t<=1000\n 2<=n<=105\n 1<=c<=n\n 2<=m<=n\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each trip to Penny Auntie, print the total number of chocolates Bobby eats on a new line.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n10 2 5\n12 4 4\n6 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n3\n5", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n10000 256 34\n234 5 2\n100000 20 34\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n40\n91\n5151", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n12345 128 340\n234 5 200\n98465 20 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n96\n46\n7384", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n12 7 29 64 14 2 8\n69 17 29 33 21 2 4\n12 14 2 3 4 5 6\n3 3 2 7 4 8 1\n87 85 35 38 21 26\n99 88 77 66 55 44 33\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n7\n0\n0\n0\n10\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
