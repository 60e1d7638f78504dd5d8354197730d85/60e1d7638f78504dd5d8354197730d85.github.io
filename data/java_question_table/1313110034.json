{"Q_ID": "1313110034", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Cut the sticks", "Q_DESC": "You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.\n\nSuppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:\n5 4 4 2 2 8\nThen, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: \n3 2 2 6\n\nThe above step is repeated until no sticks are left.\n\nGiven the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.\nNote: For each cut operation, you have to re-calcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).\n\nInput Format \nThe first line contains a single integer N . \nThe next line contains N integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where ai represents the length of the ith stick.\n\nOutput Format \nFor each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.\nConstraints\n 1<=N<=1000\n 1<=ai<=1000\n", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n5 4 4 2 2 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6\n4\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "8\n1 2 3 4 3 3 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n6\n4\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "9\n1 2 3 4 5 9 8 7 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "   3\n8 1 19\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
