The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of  v2 meters per jump. \n\nGiven the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?\n\nInput Format\n\nA single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of x1,v1 ,x2, and v2 .\n\nConstraints\n\n 0 = x1  x2 = 10000\n 1 = v1 = 10000\n 1 = v2 = 10000\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint YES if they can land on the same location at the same time; otherwise, print NO.\n\nNote: The two kangaroos must land at the same location after making the same number of jumps.\n\nSample Input \n\n0 3 4 2\n\nSample Output\n\nYES\n\nExplanation\n\n0-3-6-9-12\n4-6-8-10-12\n\nThe two kangaroos jump through the following sequence of locations:\n\nThus, the kangaroos meet after jumps and we print YES.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "0 3 4 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "0 2 5 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_3": "43 5 49 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYES", "TESTCASE_4": "7 2 9 11\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
