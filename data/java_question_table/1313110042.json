A player initially starts out on cloud c0, and they must jump to cloud cn-1. In each step, she can jump from any cloud i to cloud i+1 or cloud i+2 .\n\nThere are two types of clouds, ordinary clouds and thunderclouds. The game ends if Emma jumps onto a thundercloud, but if she reaches the last cloud (i.e.,cn-1 ), she wins the game!\n \nCan you find the minimum number of jumps Emma must make to win the game? It is guaranteed that clouds c0 and cn-1 are ordinary-clouds and it is always possible to win the game.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer,  (the total number of clouds). \n\nThe second line contains  space-separated binary integers describing clouds .\n\n If ci=0 , the ith  cloud is an ordinary cloud.\n\n If ci=1 , the ith cloud is a thundercloud.\n\nConstraints\n\n 2 = n  100\n ci  belongs {0,1}\n c0 = cn-1=0\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the minimum number of jumps needed to win the game.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "7\n0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n0 0 0 0 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3", "TESTCASE_3": "8\n0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "17\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n11", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
