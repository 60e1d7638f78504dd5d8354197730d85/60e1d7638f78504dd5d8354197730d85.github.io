{"Q_ID": "1313110093", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Lucky Four", "Q_DESC": "Kostya likes the number 4 much. Of course! This number has such a lot of properties, like:\n\n1. Four is the smallest composite number;\n2. It is also the smallest Smith number;\n3. The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;\n4. Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;\n5. There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;\n6. Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;\n7. Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;\n8. In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;\n\nAnd there are a lot more cool stuff about this number! impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.\nThen, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list\nOutput T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.\n\nConstraints\n1<=T <=105\n(Subtask 1): 0  Numbers from the list  9 - 33 points.\n(Subtask 2): 0  Numbers from the list  109 - 67 points.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n447474\n228\n6664\n40\n81\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n1\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n1234\n31\n345\n2442\n23\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1234\n31\n2442\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n447474\n228\n6664\n40\n81\n345\n2442\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
