Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?\n\nChef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:\n 1. He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.\n 2. then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.\n 3. then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.\n and so on as shown in the given figure.\n \nChef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.\n\nConstraints\n 1 =T =100\n 1 =N =109\n\nSubtasks\n Subtask 1 (48 points) : 1=N=105\n Subtask 2 (52 points) : 1=N=109\n\nExplanation\n Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height  2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.\n Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height  2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.\n Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height  3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3 5 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "7\n7 5 4 3 8 9 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n7 5 4 3 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n2\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_4": "14\n7 5 4 3 8 2 5 1 2 1 9 8 8 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3\n2\n2\n2\n3\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n3\n3\n3\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
