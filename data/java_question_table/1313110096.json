Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9  9\n\nIn 493 AD, Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were \"a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144.\"\n\nIn his 1820 book The Philosophy of Arithmetic,  mathematician John Leslie published a multiplication table up to 99  99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time. Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 25  25. The illustration below shows a table up to 12  12, which is a size commonly used in schools.\n\nInput:\nOnly element\nOutput:\nPrint the multiplication till first 10 elements", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50", "TESTCASE_2": "17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n17\n34\n51\n68\n85\n102\n119\n136\n153\n170", "TESTCASE_3": "31\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n31\n62\n93\n124\n155\n186\n217\n248\n279\n310", "TESTCASE_4": "14\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n14\n28\n42\n56\n70\n84\n98\n112\n126\n140", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
