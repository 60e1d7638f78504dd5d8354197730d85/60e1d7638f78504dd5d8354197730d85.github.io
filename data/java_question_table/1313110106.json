Harshad numbers in base n are also known as n-harshad (or n-Niven) numbers. Harshad numbers were defined by D. R. Kaprekar, a mathematician from India. The word \"harshad\" comes from the Sanskrit hara (joy) + da (give), meaning joy-giver. The term Niven number arose from a paper delivered by Ivan M. Niven at a conference on number theory in 1977. All integers between zero and n are n-harshad numbers.\n\nWrite a Program in Java to input a number and check whether it is a Harshad Numbero r Niven Number or not..\n\n An integer (in base 10) that is divisible by the sum of its digits.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "195\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_2": "194\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_3": "1108\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo", "TESTCASE_4": "200\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
