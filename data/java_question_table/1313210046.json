Detailed descriptions are as:\n\nProblem\nA sequence is said to be progressive if it doesnt decrease at any point in time.\nFor example 1 1 2 2 is a progressive sequence but 1 2 1 is not a progressive sequence. Let S be the sequence and be represented by L spaced integers Ki, now your task is to find out the first longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence (S).\n\nInput Format:\n\nFirst line will contain T, the length of the sequence and next line will contain T spaced integers Ki (where i = 0,1, ,L).\nLine 1 T,where T is the length of the sequence\nLine 2 Ki,where Ki is integer in sequence separated by space\n\nConstraints:\n\n1=T=10^6(one million)\n1=Ki=10^9(one billion)\n\nOutput Format:\n\nLine 1 longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n1 2 1 2 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2 2", "TESTCASE_2": "4                                     \n1 1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 2", "TESTCASE_3": "3\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 1", "TESTCASE_4": "2 \n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
