{"Q_ID": "1313310002", "S_NAME": "Control and Looping", "Q_NAME": "Longest Progressive Sequence", "Q_DESC": "\tA sequence is said to be progressive if it doesnt decrease at any point in time. For example 1 1 2 2 is a progressive sequence but 1 2 1 is not a progressive sequence. Let S be the sequence and be represented by L spaced integers Ki, now your task is to find out the first longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence (S).\n Input Format: First line will contain T, the length of the sequence and next line will contain T spaced integers Ki (where i = 0,1, ,L). \nLine 1 T,where T is the length of the sequence \nLine 2 Ki,where Ki is integer in sequence separated by space \nConstraints: 1<=T<=10^6(one million) 1<=Ki<=10^9(one billion) \nOutput Format: Line 1 longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence Sample Test ", "TESTCASE_1": "4 1 1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 2", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
