People connect with each other in a social network. A connection between Person I and Person J is represented as C I J. When two persons belonging to different communities connect, the net effect is merger of both communities which I and J belonged to.\n\nWe are only interested in finding out the communities with the member count being an even number. Your task is to find out those communities.\n\nInput Format:\n\nInput will consist of three parts, viz.\n\n1.
