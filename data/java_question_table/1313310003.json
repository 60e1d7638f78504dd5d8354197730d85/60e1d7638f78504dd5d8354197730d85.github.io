People connect with each other in a social network. A connection between Person I and Person J is represented as C I J. When two persons belonging to different communities connect, the net effect is merger of both communities which I and J belonged to.\n\nWe are only interested in finding out the communities with the member count being an even number. Your task is to find out those communities.\n\nInput Format:\n\nInput will consist of three parts, viz.\n\n1. The total number of people on the social network (N)\n2.Queries \nC I J, connect I and J\nQ 0 0, print the number of communities with even member-count\n-1 will represent end of input.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nFor each query Q, output the number of communities with even member-count\n\nConstraints:\n\n1<=N<=10^6\n\n1<=I, J<=N\t", "TESTCASE_1": "5\nQ 0 0\nC 1 2\nQ 0 0\nC 2 3\nQ 0 0\nC 4 5\nQ 0 0\n-1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n1\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
