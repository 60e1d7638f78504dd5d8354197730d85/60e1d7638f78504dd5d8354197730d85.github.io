Doing this perpetually, the numbers will end up to 1 or 4.\nIf a positive integer ends with 1, then it is called the Number of Game.\nAn example from above is:\n13 = 1^2 + 3^2 = 1+9 = 10 (Step:1)\n10 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1+0 = 1 (Step:2), iteration ends in Step 2 since number ends with 1\n\nThen in next round, the contestants are asked to combine their newly invented number, i.e. Number of Game with prime number.\nNow, being a smart programmer, write a program to help the contestants to find out the Nth combined number within any given range, where N can be any integer.\n\nInput Format:\n\nInput consists of 3 integers X, Y, N, one on each line. X and Y are upper and lower limits of the range. The range is inclusive of both X and Y. Find Nth number in range [X,Y].\n\nLine 1\nX,where X is the upper limit of the range\nLine 2\nY,where Y is the lower limit of the range\nLine 3\nN,where Nth element of the series is required\n\nConstraints:\n\nX = Y\nX  0\nN  0\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n30\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n19", "TESTCASE_2": "12\n33\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNo number is present at this index", "TESTCASE_3": "a -15 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nInvalid Input", "TESTCASE_4": "a -5 77\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nInvalid Input", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
