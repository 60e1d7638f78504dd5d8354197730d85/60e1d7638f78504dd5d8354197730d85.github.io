The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.\n\nKattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is \"lucky\" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and \"unlucky\" otherwise. He considered the army as \"READY FOR BATTLE\" if the count of \"lucky\" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of \"unlucky\" soldiers, and \"NOT READY\" otherwise.\n\nGiven the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" or \"NOT READY\".\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the ith soldier is holding.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n4\n11 12 13 14\n3\n2 3 4\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNOT READY\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nNOT READY", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n4\n4 6 8 9\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n9\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n10\n2 4 6 8 2 4 6 8 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nNOT READY\nNOT READY\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\n\n", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n5\n1 1 2 3 3\n7\n1 1 2 3 3 1 1\n9\n1 1 2 3 3 3 3 4 4\n3\n1 1 3\n2\n1 1\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNOT READY\nNOT READY\nNOT READY\nNOT READY\nNOT READY", "TESTCASE_4": "5\n4\n98 100 200 400\n5\n2 4 6 8 2\n7\n988 922 678 986 234 345 234\n3\n1000 100000 45555\n9\n2 4 6 8 22 44 55 66 77\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nREADY FOR BATTLE\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
