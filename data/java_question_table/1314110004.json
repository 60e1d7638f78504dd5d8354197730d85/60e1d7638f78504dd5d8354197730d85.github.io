{"Q_ID": "1314110004", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Decimal to Binary", "Q_DESC": "The decimal or denary counting system uses the Base-of-10 numbering system where each digit in a number takes on one of ten possible values, called digits, from 0 to 9, eg. 21310 (Two Hundred and Thirteen).\n\nBut as well as having 10 digits ( 0 through 9 ), the decimal numbering system also has the operations of addition ( + ), subtraction (  ), multiplication (  ) and division (  ).\n\nIn a decimal system each digit has a value ten times greater than its previous number and this decimal numbering system uses a set of symbols, b, together with a base, q, to determine the weight of each digit within a number. For example, the six in sixty has a lower weighting than the six in six hundred. Then in a binary numbering system we need some way of converting Decimal to Binary as well as back from Binary to Decimal.\n\nAny numbering system can be summarised by the following relationship:\n\n  N = bi qi\nwhere:\tN is a real positive number\nb is the digit\nq is the base value\nand integer (i) can be positive, negative or zero\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n101", "TESTCASE_2": "17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10001", "TESTCASE_3": "152\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10011000", "TESTCASE_4": "1098\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10001001010", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
