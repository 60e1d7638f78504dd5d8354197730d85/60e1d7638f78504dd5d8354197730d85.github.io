He, along with his friends, goes to his stable during the weekends to watch a few of these horses race. Chef wants his friends to enjoy the race and so he wants the race to be close. \n\nThis can happen only if the horses are comparable on their skill i.e. the difference in their skills is less.\n\nThere are N horses in the stable. The skill of the horse i is represented by an integer S[i]. \n\nThe Chef needs to pick 2 horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. This way, he would be able to host a very interesting race.
