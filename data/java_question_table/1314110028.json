Firstly, you have to tell what is the minimum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies. Secondly, you have to tell what is the maximum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the N different candies.\nIn both the cases you must utilize the offer i.e. you buy one candy and get K other candies for free.\n \n\nInput  \nThe first line of the input contains T the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains the values of N and K as described above.  Then in the next line N integers follow denoting the price of each of the N different candies.\n \n\nOutput \nFor each test case output a single line containing space separated integers , the first denoting the minimum amount of money required to be spent and the second denoting the maximum amount of money to be spent.\nRemember to output the answer of each test case in a new line.\n\nConstraints      \n1 <= T <= 50\n1 <= N <= 1000\n 0 <= K <= N-1\n1 <= Ai <= 100\n ", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n 4  2\n 3 2 1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 7", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n1 5 6 4\n4 2\n3 4 5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 7\n5 11\n7 11", "TESTCASE_3": "6\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n1 5 6 4\n4 2\n3 4 5 6\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 7\n5 11\n7 11\n3 7\n3 7\n3 7", "TESTCASE_4": "9\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n1 5 6 4\n4 2\n3 4 5 6\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n3 2 1 4\n4 2\n1 5 6 4\n4 2\n3 4 5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n3 7\n5 11\n7 11\n3 7\n3 7\n3 7\n3 7\n5 11\n7 11", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
