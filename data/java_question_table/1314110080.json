{"Q_ID": "1314110080", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Simple Statistics ", "Q_DESC": "Sergey has made N measurements. Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made.\nIn order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements.\n\nCould you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the measurements.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the average value after removing K lowest and K greatest measurements.\nYour answer will be considered correct, in case it has absolute or relative error, not exceeding 10-6.\n\n\nConstraints\n1=T=100\n1=N=104\n0=2KN\n-106=Ai=106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): K = 0\nSubtask #2 (50 points): no additional constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n5 0\n2 9 -10 25 1\n3 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput:\n4.000000\n5.400000\n1.000000\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. After removing 1 greatest and 1 lowest measurement, we get the set {2, 9, 1}. The average value in this set is (2+9+1)/3=4.\n\nExample case 2. The average value in the set {2, 9, -10, 25, 1} is (2+9-10+25+1)/5=5.4.\n\nExample case 3. After removing the 1 largest and smallest measurements, Sergey will be left with only one measurement, i.e. 1. Average of this is 1 itself.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n5 0\n2 9 -10 25 1\n3 1\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4.0\n5.4\n1.0", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "1\n3 1\n1 1 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1.0\n\n", "TESTCASE_4": "1\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4.0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
