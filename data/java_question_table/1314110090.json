{"Q_ID": "1314110090", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Occurrences of the digit 4 ", "Q_DESC": "Kostya likes the number 4 much. Of course! This number has such a lot of properties,  like:\n1. Four is the smallest composite number;\n2. It is also the smallest Smith number;\n3. The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;\n4. Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;\n5. There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;\n6. Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;\n7. Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;\n8. In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;\n9. And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!\n\nImpressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.\nThen, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.\n\nOutput\nOutput T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.\n\nConstraints\n1<=T<=105\n(Subtask 1): 0<=Numbers from the list<=9 - 33 points.\n(Subtask 2): 0<=Numbers from the list<=109 - 67 points.\n\nNote:  Use  BufferedReader\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n447474 \n228 \n6664 \n40 \n81\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n0\n1\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n123 \n3244 \n12 \n21 \n435\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n2\n0\n0\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "10\n44444\n44444 \n44444 \n44444 \n44444 \n44444 \n44444 \n44444\n44444 \n44444\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5", "TESTCASE_4": "9\n1234 \n4567 \n8901 \n2345 \n6789 \n44 \n44 \n44 \n44\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
