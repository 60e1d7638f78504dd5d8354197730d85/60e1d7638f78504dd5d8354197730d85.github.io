Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?\n\nChef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:\n\nHe puts 1 coin in the 1st row then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row  then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row and so on.\n\nChef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. \n\nCan you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFollowed by an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= N <= 10 power 9\n\nMandatory:\n1.Create a new method as follows in the main class (TestClass) \na. Method name = solve()\nb. Type = void\nc. Access Specifier = static\nd. Argument Type = no arguments \n\n2.Call the solve method inside the try block in the main method of the main class.\n3.Use the BufferReader and PrintWriter Class to get the input and to return the output. \n4.Access printStackTrace using the exception object \"e\" to print the output inside the catch block as follows\n                                            e.printStackTrace(System.out);\n\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n1\n4\n5\n8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n2\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n3\n5\n12\n18\n34\n1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n2\n4\n5\n7\n1", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n1\n5\n8\n12\n45\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n2\n3\n4\n9", "TESTCASE_4": "4\n12\n65\n13\n10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4\n10\n4\n4", "TESTCASE_5": "e.printStackTrace(System.out);\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nstatic void solve()"}
