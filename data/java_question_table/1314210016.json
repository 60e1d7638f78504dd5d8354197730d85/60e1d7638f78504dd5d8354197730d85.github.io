{"Q_ID": "1314210016", "S_NAME": "Arrays", "Q_NAME": "Flatland Space Stations", "Q_DESC": "Flatland is a country with n cities,  m of which have space stations. Each city,ci , is numbered with a distinct index from 0 to n-1 , and each city ci is connected to city ci+1  by a bidirectional road that is 1km  in length.\nFor example, if n=5 and cities c0 and c4 have space stations, then Flatland looks like this:\n \nFor each city, determine its distance to the nearest space station and print the maximum of these distances.\nInput Format\nThe first line consists of two space-separated integers, n and m . \nThe second line contains m space-separated integers describing the respective indices of each city having a space-station. These values are unordered and unique.\nConstraints\n 1<=n<=105\n 1<=m<=n\n It is guaranteed that there will be at least 1 city with a space station, and no city has more than one.\nOutput Format\nPrint an integer denoting the maximum distance that an astronaut in a Flatland city would need to travel to reach the nearest space station.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "5 2\n0 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
