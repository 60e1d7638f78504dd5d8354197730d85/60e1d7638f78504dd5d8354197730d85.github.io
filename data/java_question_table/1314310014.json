For example 1 1 2 2 is a progressive sequence but 1 2 1 is not a progressive sequence. Let S be the sequence and be represented by L spaced integers Ki, now your task is to find out the first longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence (S). Input Format: First line will contain T, the length of the sequence and next line will contain T spaced integers Ki (where i = 0,1, ,L). Line 1 T,where T is the length of the sequence Line 2 Ki,where Ki is integer in sequence separated by space Constraints: 1<=T<=10^6(one million) 1<=Ki<=10^9(one billion) Output Format: Line 1 longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence.", "TESTCASE_1": "4 1 1 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 2", "TESTCASE_2": "4 1 3 1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 2", "TESTCASE_3": "3 1 1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 1 4", "TESTCASE_4": "241\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
