{"Q_ID": "1315110013", "S_NAME": "Classes and Objects", "Q_NAME": "Most Occurance", "Q_DESC": "kamal is a data analyst in a lottery management organization\nOne of the tasks assigned to kamal is to find the most frequently occurring digit in a series of input number. Below are a couple of examples to illustrates how to find the most frequently occurring digit in a series of \n\nInput numbers\n\n Example 1\n            if the series of input number are[1236,262,666,121]\n            we notice that\n            0 occurs 0 time\n            1 occurs 3 times\n            2 occurs 4 times\n            3 occurs 1 time\n            4 occurs 0 time\n            5 occurs 0 time\n            6 occurs 5 times\n            7 occurs 0 time\n            8 occurs 0 time\n            9 occurs 0 time\n-6 is the digit that occur 5 times\n\n NOTE1:if more than one digit occur the most frequently time then the highest of the digits should be chosen as the answer see below example for clarity on this part\n\n Example 2-\n\n            if the series of input number are[1237,202,666,140]\n            we notice that\n            0 occurs 2 times\n            1 occurs 2 times\n            2 occurs 3 times\n            3 occurs 1 time\n            4 occurs 1 time\n            5 occurs 0 time\n            6 occurs 3 times\n            7 occurs 1 time\n            8 occurs 0 time\n            9 occurs 0 time\n\nwe observe that\n2,6 are the digits that occur 3 times\n\nThe highest of these two digits (2,6)thus the most frequently occurring digit in this series is 6.\n\nKamal decides to write the logic in the below method for finding the most Frequently occurring Digit in the protocol input series of numbers\n\nMandatory:\n\n1. Create a Class MostOccurance with method name as check\n\na.  Methodname - check()\nb.  Return Type = void\nc. Access specifier = public\nd. Argument = No argument\n\n2. Create instance for the class MostOccurance  and access check method.
