This function is used to set the values for length, width and ratePerSqFeet. The arguments are passed to this function in the\nsame order.\n\ngetLength() --- to return the length of the building\n\ngetWidth() --- to return the width of the building\n\ngetRatePerSqFeet() --- to return the ratePerSqft of the building\n\ncalculateCost() --- to calculate and return the cost of the building\n\ndetermineSuitability() --- to determine and return the type of the building. \n\nWe are interested in Buildings that are almost in the shape of a square. If the length and width of the building differ by atmost 10, then the building is suitable. If the difference between the length and width of the building is more than 10, then it is not suitable. In the main function / method, create an object of type buiding and invoke the corresponding methods.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "34\n56\n54\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength : 34\nWidth : 56\nRate Per SqFt : 54\nCost of the Building : 102816\nSuitability : Not Suitable", "TESTCASE_2": "400\n395                  \n1000\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLength : 400\nWidth : 395\nRate Per SqFt : 1000\nCost of the Building : 158000000\nSuitability : Suitable", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "objname.getRatePerSqFeet()\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nobjname.determineSuitability()"}
