The Principal has asked Ms.Rita of CSE department to shortlist the students who are eligible for this post based on the given criteria. Ms. Rita is very passionate about programming and she decides to automate this task. As the students at SRM are very sincere, she found that most of the students maintain an attendance percentage of 100%. \n\nWhen she analyzed the students data further, she was very surprised as well as delighted to find an accidental coincidence in the marks distribution. \n\nMost of the students have scored 90% marks. Ms.Rita has just learnt about default arguments and she was eager to test her knowledge on it.
