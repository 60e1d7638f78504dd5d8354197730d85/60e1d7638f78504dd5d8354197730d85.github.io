{"Q_ID": "1315210003", "S_NAME": "Classes and Objects", "Q_NAME": "Ciel and Map", "Q_DESC": "Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.\n\nTomya writes a tetragon (see the below Notes 1 for details) in her map. The map has N points, whose coordinate are (Xi, Yi), denoting Ciel's restaurants. Each vertex of the tetragon written by Tomya is one of the Ciel's restaurants.\n\nTomya doesn't show her tetragon in the map, but she says that she draws a long segment. To guess her tetragon, please tell the maximum length of a segment which can be one of the sides in her tetragon. (See Notes 2 for the definition of length)\n\nNotes 1:\nA tetragon means a polygon with 4 sides.\nA tetragon must be simple, that is, the boundary of the tetragon does not cross itself.\nA tetragon does not have to be convex.\n\nNotes 2:\nThe length of a segment is defined as the Euclidean distance between the endpoints. That is, the length of the segment (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) is the square root of (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integers N. Then next N lines follow. The i-th line contains 2 integers denoting Xi and Yi.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the maximum length of a segment which can be one of sides in her tetragon. This value must have an absolute error no more than 0.000001 (10-6).\n\nConstraints\n\n1  T  1250\n4  N  1000\n1  Xi, Yi  5000\nThe sum of N in one test file does not exceed 5000.\nNo three points (Xi, Yi), (Xj, Yj), (Xk, Yk) lie in the same line (1  i < j < k  N)", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n6\n3 1\n5 2\n3 3\n6 3\n6 6\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5.83095189", "TESTCASE_2": "1\n6\n3 1\n4 1\n3 3\n6 3\n6 6\n5 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5.83095189", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
