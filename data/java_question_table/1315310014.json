Ciel is bored, so she decides to take a walk randomly.\n\nThis town has N intersections and M one way roads. The i-th road connects from the Ai-th intersection to the Bi-th intersection. Ciel is in the 1st intersection now, and Ciel's house is in the N-th intersection.\n\nIf Ciel is in the i-th intersection, she will take a walk as follows:\n\nIf i = N, her walk is ended.\nOtherwise, she chooses an integer k such that Ak = i uniformly randomly, she walks along the k-th road.\nOn the way, S intersections have beautiful flowers. Let the F1-th intersection, the F2-th intersection, ..., and the FS-th intersection have beautiful flowers. Can you tell the probability that Ciel last sees the flowers in the Fi-th intersection? That is to say, can you tell the probability that she visits the Fi-th intersection, then she goes to N-th intersection without visiting other intersections having beautiful flowers?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 3 integers N, M and S. Then, next line has S integers F1, F2, ..., FS. Next M lines have 2 integers each, Ai and Bi.\n\nOutput\n\nAn output should contain S lines. In the i-th line, print the probability that Ciel last sees beautiful flowers at the Fi-th intersection. These values must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  S < N  30\n1  F1 < F2 < ... < FS < N\nAi  Bi\nIf i  j and Ai = Aj, then Bi  Bj\nFor each 1  i < N, Ciel can go from the i-th intersection to the N-th intersection, directly or ", "TESTCASE_1": "4 6 3\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 3\n3 1\n2 4\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0\n0.5\n0.5", "TESTCASE_2": "4 6 1\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n1 3\n3 1\n2 4\n3 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0.6666666666667", "TESTCASE_3": "2 1 1\n1\n1 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
