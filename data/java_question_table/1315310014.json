Ciel is bored, so she decides to take a walk randomly.\n\nThis town has N intersections and M one way roads. The i-th road connects from the Ai-th intersection to the Bi-th intersection. Ciel is in the 1st intersection now, and Ciel's house is in the N-th intersection.\n\nIf Ciel is in the i-th intersection, she will take a walk as follows:\n\nIf i = N, her walk is ended.\nOtherwise, she chooses an integer k such that Ak = i uniformly randomly, she walks along the k-th road.\nOn the way, S intersections have beautiful flowers. Let the F1-th intersection, the F2-th intersection, ..., and the FS-th intersection have beautiful flowers. Can you tell the probability that Ciel last sees the flowers in the Fi-th intersection? That is to say, can you tell the probability that she visits the Fi-th intersection, then she goes to N-th intersection without visiting other intersections having beautiful flowers?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains 3 integers N, M and S. Then, next line has S integers F1, F2, ..., FS. Next M lines have 2 integers each, Ai and Bi.\n\nOutput\n\nAn output should contain S lines. In the i-th line, print the probability that Ciel last sees beautiful flowers at the Fi-th intersection. These values must have an absolute error no more than 10-6.\n\nConstraints\n\n1  S  N  30\n1  F1  F2  ...
