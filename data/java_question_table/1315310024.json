{"Q_ID": "1315310024", "S_NAME": "Classes and Objects", "Q_NAME": "Sines Sum Queries", "Q_DESC": "You are given a sequence of integers A0, A1, ..., AN-1. Initially Ai=i for all i. You need to perform some strange queries with it. Each query has the form \"L R D\" where 0 <= L <= R < N and D is an integer. If D=0 then you need to find the sum of sines of the numbers AL, AL+1, ..., AR that is sin AL + ... + sin AR. Otherwise you need to add D to the numbers AL, AL+1, ..., AR.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two positive integers N and Q. Here, N <= 109 is the length of the initial sequence and Q <= 100000 is the number of queries you need to perform with it. The next Q lines describe queries, one per line. The i'th such line contains three integers L, R and D. Here 0 <= L <= R < N and -10000 <= D <= 10000.\n\nOutput\n\nThe output consists of answers for all queries where D=0. For each such query you must produce a line with the corresponding sines sum. Answers within an absolute error of 10-6 will be accepted.", "TESTCASE_1": "5 6\n0 4 0\n0 2 1\n3 4 2\n0 4 0\n2 3 -1\n1 4 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1.1350859\n0.65354865\n0.782376860", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
