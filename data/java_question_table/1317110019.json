Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named Uncle Johny.\n\nAfter creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, Uncle Johny was on K-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.\n\nVlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of Uncle Johny in the sorted playlist.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist.
