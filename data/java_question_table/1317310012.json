The room numbers will always have three digits, i.e. it starts from 100 and can span upto 999.\nThe Wi-Fi pin is always a string of length 4, a combination which is created as per below rules.\nRule 1- The units value of the Wi-Fi pin must be same as the tens value of the room number.\nRule 2- The tens value of the Wi-Fi pin must be same as the first character of the guests last name.\nRule 3- The hundred value of the Wi-Fi pin must be the special character equivalent of the units value of the room number. The special character details to be used are as given below-\n1- ! , 2-@ ,  3-#, 4-$, 5-%, 6-^, 7-&, 8-*, 9-(, 10-)\n\nRule 4- The thousands value of the Wi-Fi pin must be created performing digitsum on the room number i.e by performing continuous addition of all the digits of the room number till we get a single digit number. If the obtained single digit number is an even number, then it is used as it is.\nIf the obtained single digit number is an odd number, then it is incremented by 1 and it is used.\nIn Rule 4 Zero should be considered as a neutral number(neither even nor odd). So, if sum of all digits results to 1 then the even number 2 must be used.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "210\nabhyuday\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4)a1", "TESTCASE_2": "120\nkaran\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4)k2", "TESTCASE_3": "105\nbala\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n6%b0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
