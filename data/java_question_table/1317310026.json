{"Q_ID": "1317310026", "S_NAME": "Strings", "Q_NAME": "Making Anagrams", "Q_DESC": "Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful. We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.\n\nAlice decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Can you help her find this number?\n\nGiven two strings, a and b, that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make a and b  anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single string,a . \nThe second line contains a single string,b .\nConstraints\n1 less than equal to a and b less than 10000\nIt is guaranteed that  a and b consist of lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single integer denoting the number of characters which must be deleted to make the two strings anagrams of each other.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "cde\nabc\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_2": "aacabaa\naabbcca\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "malayalam\nmalayal\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2", "TESTCASE_4": "aacabaa\naabbcca\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
