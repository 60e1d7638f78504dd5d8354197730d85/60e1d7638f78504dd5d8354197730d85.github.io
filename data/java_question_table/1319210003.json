Bob doesn't think she has learnt it properly and hence he has decided to quiz her. Bob gives Alice a very large number and asks her to find out the number of factors of that number. To make it a little easier for her, he represents the number as a product of N numbers. Alice is frightened of big numbers and hence is asking you for help. Your task is simple. Given N numbers, you need to tell the number of distinct factors of the product of these N numbers.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n3 5 7\n3\n2 4 6\n2\n5 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n8\n10\n3", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n4\n3 5 7 8\n3\n2 4 4\n2\n5 7\n3\n3 5 7\n1\n22\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n32\n6\n4\n8\n4", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
