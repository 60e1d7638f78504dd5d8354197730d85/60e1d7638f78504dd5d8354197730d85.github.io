Now he wants to know whether there exists some valid statistic A of size N (may contain real numbers) such that after rounding it up, it becomes same as B?\n\nInput", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n30 30 30\n4\n25 25 25 25\n2\n50 51\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\nYES\nYES", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n5\n50 50 50 05 00\n4\n25 25 25 25\n2\n50 51\n1\n25\n3\n20 11 12\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nNO\n", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
