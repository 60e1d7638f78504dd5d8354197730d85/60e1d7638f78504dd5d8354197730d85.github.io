{"Q_ID": "1319210011", "S_NAME": "Exceptional Handling", "Q_NAME": "Glass Measurement", "Q_DESC": "Chef has n glasses each with a capacity of xi. \nThere are Q+1 people playing a game including the Chef himself. Everyone at his/her turn gives a positive integer Mi and asks the Chef if volume M of water can be transferred using the n glasses with Chef. Chef at his own turn wants to give M as the highest integer volume which cannot be constructed using these n glasses. \nSo, you need to help chef with this game. \nAssume that to construct a volume M, we have a reserve with infinite volume of liquid. If Chef uses ith glass, he has to transfer a volume equal to xi in one turn. He can use a glass multiple times. However, transfer of liquid between glasses is not permitted. For example, you cannot obtain volume of 2 by tranferring liquid from glass of volume 5 to glass of volume 3. \nIt is always possible to construct volume 0.", "TESTCASE_1": "1\n2\n3 5\n2\n8 1 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7\n1 1", "TESTCASE_2": "2\n2\n5 8\n2\n2 1 9\n2\n6 6\n2\n9 9 9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n27\n1 1\n-1\n0 2", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
