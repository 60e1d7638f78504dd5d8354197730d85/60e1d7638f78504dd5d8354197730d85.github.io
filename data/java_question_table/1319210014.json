{"Q_ID": "1319210014", "S_NAME": "Exceptional Handling", "Q_NAME": "Misha and Gym", "Q_DESC": "When Misha hits his favorite gym, he comes across an interesting problem with the barbell. In the gym, someone always leaves the weight plates in the strangest places you can imagine and sometime it's difficult to equip the barbell the way you want. Let's imagine that you have N weight plates placed in any order (remember that any gym has no more than K different types of weight plates and all weights are square-free). As a preliminary step towards solving this problem, Misha wants to simulate a simple gym, and for this purpose you have to deal with some queries:\n\n[1 I X] Set the weight of the ith weight plate to value X.\n[2 L R] Reverse the sequence of weight plates in the interval from L to R, where 1  L  R  N.\n[3 L R W] Check the interval from L to R to find out if you can make the weight W using only weight plates on this interval. (Note: this type of query will appear no more than P times)", "TESTCASE_1": "5 10\n1 2 3 5 6\n3 2 3 3\n3 2 3 4\n3 2 3 5\n2 2 5\n3 2 4 8\n1 2 1\n3 2 4 8\n2 1 4 \n3 2 4 3 \n3 1 5 7 \n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n", "TESTCASE_2": "5 5\n1 2 3 5 6\n3 2 3 3\n3 2 3 4\n3 2 3 5\n2 2 5\n2 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
