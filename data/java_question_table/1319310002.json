But when Emily arrived at the airport, she realized that she had got no presents for her K friends! She still had some time before her flight, so she went for a walk around the airport hoping to find something suitable.\n\nSoon Emily found a candy store and decided to buy some of her favorite candies for her friends. The store offers N packs of these candies, where pack i contains Ai candies.\n\nAnother reason Emily decided to buy candies is that she is fond of collecting empty candy packs from various parts of the world. That's why she decided to buy exactly M packs and present the friends with the candies and keep the packs for her collection. Emily would also like the total number of candies to be divisible by K so that an equal distribution of candies between friends is possible. Among all possible sets of packs, she would like to buy a set with the smallest possible total number of candies (money is the reason).\n\nYour task is to help Emily, of course.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n5 3 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 3 4\n9 5 1 7 3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n10\n-1", "TESTCASE_2": "6\n4 3 5\n1 2 3 4 \n3 3 4\n9 5 1 \n5 3 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 3 4\n9 5 1 7 3 7\n5 3 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 3 4\n9 5 1 7 3 7\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
