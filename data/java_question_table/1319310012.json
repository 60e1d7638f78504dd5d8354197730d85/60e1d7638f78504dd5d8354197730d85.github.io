{"Q_ID": "1319310012", "S_NAME": "Exceptional Handling", "Q_NAME": "How To Operate a Robot", "Q_DESC": "There is s a square maze consisting of N rows and N columns divided into unit cells. The rows are numbered from the top to the bottom starting from 1, and the columns are numbered from the left to the right also starting from 1.\n\nYou have a robot which you have to operate. Initially the robot is located in the upper-left corner of the maze (i.e. at the cell (1, 1)). In a single move you can move the robot in any one of four basic directions: left, right, up or down.\n\nSome cells of the maze are forbidden. It is known that there are no two forbidden cells that share an edge or a corner. The cell (1, 1) is not forbidden.\n\nYou have to construct a sequence of moves of the robot satisfying the following conditions.\n\nRobot never leaves the maze.\nRobot never visits a forbidden cell.\nRobot visits each non-forbidden cell of the maze at least once.\nYou are interested in finding any valid sequence of moves such that there are no more than three consecutive moves that moved the robot in the same direction eg. 'DDDD' is invalid sequence of moves while 'D' and 'DDD' is valid. Also total number of moves should not be more than N * (N + 7). Please find any such sequence.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n2\n..\n.#\n3\n...\n#..\n..#\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nDUR\nRDURDLDURLDUDL\n", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n.....\n....#\n#....\n....#\n#....\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nDRURDRURLDDRLDULDLUDLRDULRDURDURDUDR\n\nRDURDLDURLDUDL\n\nDRURDRURDURLDDRLDULDLULDLRUDLRDDLRURDRURDUR\n\nRDURDLDURLDUDL", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
