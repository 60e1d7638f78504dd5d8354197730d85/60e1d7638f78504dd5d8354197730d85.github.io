{"Q_ID": "1319310013", "S_NAME": "Exceptional Handling", "Q_NAME": "Coloring in Hypercube", "Q_DESC": "In an N-dimensional grid the co-ordinates of a cell are denoted as X1, X2, ..., XN. Any cell with negative co-ordinate are colored white. The origin cell (the one with all zero co-ordinates) is colored as black. The color of a cell in (X1, X2, ..., XN) depends on the N cells with co-ordinates (X1-1, X2, ..., XN), (X1, X2-1, ..., XN), ...., (X1, X2, ..., XN-1). The cell is colored white if and only if the number of black colored cells among these N co-ordinates are even, otherwise the cell is colored black.\n\nYou are given the starting and ending co-ordinate of sub-hypercube. You need to compute how many hyper cells in this sub hypercube are colored black.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n3\n4 0 4\n7 9 8\n2\n0 3\n10 9\n4\n0 3 0 2\n6 8 1 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n9\n32\n22", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
