The program is to correctly write out the users age in years.\nThe program will have to determine when a two digit value such as\"62\"corresponds to a year in the 20th century (\"1962\") or the 2lst century. Here is another run of the program, where\"00\"is taken to mean the year 2000:\nAssume that ages are not negative. The age of the person could be 6 or 106 depending on the assumptions.
