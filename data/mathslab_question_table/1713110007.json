Write a program that asks the user for the number of bolts, nuts, and washers in their purchase and then calculates and prints out the total. As an added feature, the program checks the order. A correct order must have at least as many nuts as bolts and at least twice as many washers as bolts, otherwise the order has an error. For an error the program writes out \"check the Order: too few nuts\" or \"Check the Order : too few washers\" as appropriate. Both error messages are written if the order has both errors. If there are no errors the program writes out \"Order is OK.\" In all cases the total price in rupees (of the specified number of items) is written out.\n(Hint Don not use any operator symbol (<,<=,>,>=,+.-,*).
