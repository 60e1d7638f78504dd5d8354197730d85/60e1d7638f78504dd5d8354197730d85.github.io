{"Q_ID": "1715110014", "S_NAME": "Control Structures", "Q_NAME": "Buzz Game", "Q_DESC": "In the standard version of the math game Buzz, players begin counting and whenever a player reaches a number that has seven as a digit or is divisible by seven, he says \"Buzz\" instead of the number. Numbers such as seventy require the player to say \"Buzz Buzz\": Once because the number contains the digit \"7\" and once because the number is divisible by \"7\". However, if one of the two properties holds more than once (for example, the number 771 contains the digit 7 twice) the player only says \"Buzz\" once for each property that holds. \nSRM team is about to participate in the game of Buzz and the SRM Buzz team coach requests you to help him in automating this training program by writing a program. Can you please help him out?\n", "TESTCASE_1": "70\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBuzz Buzz", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "771\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nBuzz", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
