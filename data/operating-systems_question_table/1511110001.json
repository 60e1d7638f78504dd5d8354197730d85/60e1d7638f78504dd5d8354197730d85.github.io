Fn) to SRM Restaurant for a treat. The waiter noted the order of F1, F2, F3. Fn as O1, O2, O3. On respectively. Assuming the waiter services the groups that comes on first to his table.\n\nPrint the waiting time, time at which chef starts to prepare the order (Preparation start time) (service time) and time in which the order completes (turnaround time) for each one of them. Print the average waiting and average turnaround time. \n\nAssume F1 gets the menu first and orders first then F2 and so on Therefore the time at which the order is given to the waiter (Arrival time) changes for each friend. \n\nInput: The first line contains the Number of friend/s. The next n line contains the Friend name, order give time(Burst Time) and time taken by chef to cook that order for F1, F2, F3. Fn. (Arrival Time)\n\n\nOutput: - The first n lines should print input values, waiting time and Time in which the order completes (Turn Around time) for each friend in each line.
