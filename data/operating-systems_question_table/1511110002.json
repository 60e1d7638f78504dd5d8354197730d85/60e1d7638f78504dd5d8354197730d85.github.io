{"Q_ID": "1511110002", "S_NAME": "CPU Scheduling Algorithms", "Q_NAME": "Bogar Birthday Party - Day 2", "Q_DESC": "Bogar a student of TAMIL Siddha College On his birthday took his n Friends (F1, F2, F3. Fn) to Naturopathy hotel for a treat.  The waiter noted the order of F1, F2, F3. Fn as O1, O2, O3. On respectively. \n\nBogar asked the waiter about the type of algorithm he follows to give order to chef to prepare. Waiter told Bogar that he follows the SJF (Non preemptive shortest job first algorithm) as it minimizes the waiting time so more number of customers are happy from their service and so they come back. \n\nPrint the waiting time, time at which chef starts to prepare the order (Preparation start time) (service time) and time in which the order completes (turnaround time) for each one of them.\n\nPrint the average waiting and average turnaround time. Assume F1 gets the menu first and orders first then F2 and so on Therefore the time at which the order is given to the waiter (Arrival time) changes for each friend. \n\nInput: The first line contains the Number of friend/s. The next n line contains the Friend name, order give time(Burst Time) and time taken by chef to cook that order for F1, F2, F3. Fn. (Arrival Time=0)\n\n\nOutput: - The first n lines should print input values, waiting time and Time in which the order completes (Turn Around time) for each friend in each line. Print average waiting and average turnaround time in next two lines respectively", "TESTCASE_1": "4\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\n3 6 4 2\n0 0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Burst Time\neVerifyTeam 2 0\neLabTeam 3 0\neCurriculaTeam 4 0\neThinkTeam 6 0\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=0\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=2\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=5\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=9\nAverage Waiting Time=4.000000\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=2\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=5\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=9\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=15\nAverage TurnAround Time=7.750000", "TESTCASE_2": "5\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\neSkillTeam\n3 6 4 2 7\n0 0 0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Burst Time\neVerifyTeam 2 0\neLabTeam 3 0\neCurriculaTeam 4 0\neThinkTeam 6 0\neSkillTeam 7 0\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=0\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=2\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=5\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=9\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=15\nAverage Waiting Time=6.200000\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=2\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=5\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=9\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=15\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=22\nAverage TurnAround Time=10.600000", "TESTCASE_3": "6\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\neSkillTeam\neResearchTeam\n3 6 4 2 7 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Burst Time\neResearchTeam 1 0\neVerifyTeam 2 0\neLabTeam 3 0\neCurriculaTeam 4 0\neThinkTeam 6 0\neSkillTeam 7 0\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eResearchTeam=0\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=1\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=3\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=6\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=10\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=16\nAverage Waiting Time=6.000000\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eResearchTeam=1\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=3\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=6\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=10\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=16\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=23\nAverage TurnAround Time=9.833333", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
