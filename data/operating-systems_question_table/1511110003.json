{"Q_ID": "1511110003", "S_NAME": "CPU Scheduling", "Q_NAME": "Chirag Party - Day 3", "Q_DESC": "Chirag a student of SRM UNIVERSITY On his birthday took his n Friends (F1, F2, F3. Fn) to SRM Restaurant for a treat. The waiter noted the order of F1, F2, F3. Fn as O1, O2, O3. On respectively. \n\nConsider F1, F2, F3. Fn as different customers. Chirag Yadav a smart person observed that some people were given special treatment and their order was prepared before them but those people came after them (Not FCFS). \n\nSo, Chirag Yadav asked the waiter about this and the waiter told that those people were their regular customers so they give more priority to them. \nHe also told Chirag that they maintain a database which records the number of times a customer visit their restaurant as they visit more time the priority level increases. \n\nConsidering that once an order is given to the chef it cannot be taken back even if a high priority order comes but at the time of giving the chef a new order to prepare one with the higher priority will be given first.\n\nPrint the waiting time, time at which chef starts to prepare the order (Preparation start time) (service time) and time in which the order completes (turnaround time) for each one of them. \n\nPrint the average waiting and average turnaround time. Assume F1 gets the menu first and orders first then F2 and so on Therefore the time at which the order is given to the waiter (Arrival time) changes for each friend. \n\nInput: The first line contains the Number of friend/s. The next n line contains the Friend name, order give time(Burst Time) and time taken by chef to cook that order for F1, F2, F3. Fn. (Arrival Time=0) and Priority of each friends\n\nOutput: - The first n lines should print input values, waiting time and Time in which the order completes (Turn Around time) for each friend in each line. Print average waiting and average turnaround time in next two lines respectively", "TESTCASE_1": "5\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\neSkillTeam\n3 6 4 2 7\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 1 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Priority\neCurriculaTeam 4 0 1\neThinkTeam 6 0 2\neLabTeam 3 0 3\neVerifyTeam 2 0 4\neSkillTeam 7 0 5\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=0\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=4\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=10\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=13\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=15\nAverage Waiting Time=8.400000\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=4\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=10\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=13\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=15\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=22\nAverage TurnAround Time=12.800000", "TESTCASE_2": "6\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\neSkillTeam\neResearchTeam\n3 6 4 2 7 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 1 6 4 5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Priority\neCurriculaTeam 4 0 1\neThinkTeam 6 0 2\neLabTeam 3 0 3\neSkillTeam 7 0 4\neResearchTeam 1 0 5\neVerifyTeam 2 0 6\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=0\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=4\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=10\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=13\nTime Taken for eResearchTeam=20\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=21\nAverage Waiting Time=11.333333\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=4\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=10\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=13\nTime Taken for eSkillTeam=20\nTime Taken for eResearchTeam=21\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=23\nAverage TurnAround Time=15.166667", "TESTCASE_3": "4\neLabTeam\neThinkTeam\neCurriculaTeam\neVerifyTeam\n3 6 4 2\n0 0 0 0\n3 2 1 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nSorting Depend on Priority\neCurriculaTeam 4 0 1\neThinkTeam 6 0 2\neLabTeam 3 0 3\neVerifyTeam 2 0 4\nWaiting Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=0\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=4\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=10\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=13\nAverage Waiting Time=6.750000\nTurnAround Time\nTime Taken for eCurriculaTeam=4\nTime Taken for eThinkTeam=10\nTime Taken for eLabTeam=13\nTime Taken for eVerifyTeam=15\nAverage TurnAround Time=10.500000", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
