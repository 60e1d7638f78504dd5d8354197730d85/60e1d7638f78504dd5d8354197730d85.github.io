{"Q_ID": "1511110005", "S_NAME": "CPU Scheduling Algorithms", "Q_NAME": "Airport with Arrival Time", "Q_DESC": "Semester break has started and Bogar is going home from College (Tamil Siddha College). He is taking flight from Chennai to Delhi. After entering the Airport, he was asked to get into queue of the Boarding Pass. The Airline staff (Jet Airways) follows the First Come First Service algorithm and first process the request of the person with the First Come First Basics condition for the Jet Airways.\n\nBogar is a programmer and wanted to gift a program to the airline which shows the service time (time at which that person will reach the counter), waiting time (service time -arrival time) for each person in the queue and turnaround time (total time from arrival till person gets boarding pass). Also, Calculate average waiting and average turnaround time.\n\nInput: The first line contains the Number of Passengers n. The next n line contains the arrival time and the burst time of that passenger. \n\nExample:\nIn First Test Case\n0 5\n0 = Arrival Time\n5 = Burst Time\n\nOutput: - The first n lines should print input values, waiting time (service time -arrival time) for each person in the queue and turnaround time (total time from arrival till person gets boarding pass). \n\nIn next two lines Print average waiting and average turnaround time in next two lines respectively", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n0 5\n1 3\n2 8\n3 6\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess 1\nTurn Around Time=5\nWaiting Time=0\nProcess 2\nTurn Around Time=7\nWaiting Time=4\nProcess 3\nTurn Around Time=14\nWaiting Time=6\nProcess 4\nTurn Around Time=19\nWaiting Time=13\nAverage waiting time=5.750000\nAverage turn around time=11.250000", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n0 4\n2 9\n4 8\n3 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess 1\nTurn Around Time=4\nWaiting Time=0\nProcess 2\nTurn Around Time=11\nWaiting Time=2\nProcess 3\nTurn Around Time=17\nWaiting Time=9\nProcess 4\nTurn Around Time=21\nWaiting Time=18\nAverage waiting time =7.250000\nAverage turn around time=13.250000", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
