Fn) to SRM Restaurant for a treat. The waiter noted the order of F1, F2, F3. Fn as O1, O2, O3 and so on respectively. \n\nAssuming the waiter follows the FCFS algorithm. Print the waiting time, time at which chef starts to prepare the order (Preparation start time) (service time) and time in which the order completes (turnaround time) for each one of them. Print the average waiting and average turnaround time. \n\nAssume F1 gets the menu first and orders first then F2 and so on Therefore the time at which the order is given to the waiter (Arrival time) changes for each friend.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains the Number of friend/s. The next n line contains order given time of F1, F2, F3. Fn. \n\nOutput Format:\nThe first n lines should print order given time, waiting time and Time in which the order completes (Turn Around time) for each friend in each line. Print average waiting and average turnaround time in next two lines respectively.", "TESTCASE_1": "3\n12 \n20 \n50\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF1 12.00 0.00 12.00\nF2 20.00 12.00 32.00\nF3 50.00 32.00 82.00\nAverage Waiting Time = 14.666667\nAverage Turnaround Time = 42.000000", "TESTCASE_2": "4\n10\n19\n32\n17\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF1 10.00 0.00 10.00\nF2 19.00 10.00 29.00\nF3 32.00 29.00 61.00\nF4 17.00 61.00 78.00\nAverage Waiting Time = 25.000000\nAverage Turnaround Time = 44.500000", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n12\n62\n10\n33\n24\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF1 12.00 0.00 12.00\nF2 62.00 12.00 74.00\nF3 10.00 74.00 84.00\nF4 33.00 84.00 117.00\nF5 24.00 117.00 141.00\nAverage Waiting Time = 57.400002\nAverage Turnaround Time = 85.599998", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n18\n43\n41\n34\n23\n11\n19\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF1 18.00 0.00 18.00\nF2 43.00 18.00 61.00\nF3 41.00 61.00 102.00\nF4 34.00 102.00 136.00\nF5 23.00 136.00 159.00\nF6 11.00 159.00 170.00\nF7 19.00 170.00 189.00\nAverage Waiting Time = 92.285713\nAverage Turnaround Time = 119.285713", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
