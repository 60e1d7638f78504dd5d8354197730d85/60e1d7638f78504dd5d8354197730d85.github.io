Fn) to SRM Restaurant for a treat. The waiter noted the order of F1, F2, F3. Fn as O1, O2, O3 and so on respectively. \n\nJadeja asked the waiter about the type of algorithm he follows to give order to chef to prepare. Waiter told Jadeja that he follows the Primitive SJF (shortest job first algorithm) as it minimize the waiting time so more number of customers are happy from their service and so they come back.If the Friend orders the menu and it is in preparation process and in between if another friend orders an item which has less preparation time than the current menu preparation time then the preparation of current menu is stopped and preparation of new order with short preparation time is started.\n\nInput: \nThe first line contains the Number of friend/s. The next n line contains the order give time(Burst time) and the priority. \n\nOutput:\nThe first n lines should print Friends name,Burst time, waiting time and Time in which the order completes (Turnaround Time) for each friend in each line. Print average waiting and average turnaround time in next two lines respectively.", "TESTCASE_1": "4\n56 5\n51 3\n40 1\n60 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF3 40 0 40\nF4 60 40 100\nF2 51 100 151\nF1 56 151 207\nAverage Waiting Time:72.000000\nAverage Turnaround Time:124.000000", "TESTCASE_2": "3\n20 6\n87 3\n39 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF3 39 0 39\nF2 87 39 126\nF1 20 126 146\nAverage Waiting Time:55.000000\nAverage Turnaround Time:103.000000", "TESTCASE_3": "7\n68 2\n34 4\n56 1\n45 6\n76 5\n80 3\n63 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF3 56 0 56\nF1 68 56 124\nF6 80 124 204\nF2 34 204 238\nF5 76 238 314\nF4 45 314 359\nF7 63 359 422\nAverage Waiting Time:185.000000\nAverage Turnaround Time:245.000000", "TESTCASE_4": "5\n55 2\n78 1\n20 6\n87 4\n12 8\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nF2 78 0 78\nF1 55 78 133\nF4 87 133 220\nF3 20 220 240\nF5 12 240 252\nAverage Waiting Time:134.000000\nAverage Turnaround Time:184.000000", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
