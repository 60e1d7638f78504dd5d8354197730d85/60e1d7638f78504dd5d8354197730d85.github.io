It then allocates the very next available memory block to the succeeding processes.\n\nSo, when a process is executed to be stored in the memory, the previous bin or the memory block is checked for its availability.\n\nIf it is free, then a process is written in the same memory block or else, the next block is checked.While allocating memory blocks, the algorithm begins as the first fit to find a free partition. Next time when the algorithm is called, it starts searching from where it left off, not from the beginning.", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n10 23 21 31 52\n5\n40 21 30 10 15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess [1] Allocated to Memory Block: 1\nProcess [2] Allocated to Memory Block: 3\nProcess [3] Unallocated\nProcess [4] Unallocated\nProcess [5] Unallocated", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n12 11 14 15 17\n6\n20 10 30 25 15 10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess [1] Allocated to Memory Block: 1\nProcess [2] Allocated to Memory Block: 3\nProcess [3] Allocated to Memory Block: 4\nProcess [4] Allocated to Memory Block: 5\nProcess [5] Unallocated", "TESTCASE_3": "5\n31 21 11 22 10\n6\n10 20 35 15 25 32\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess [1] Allocated to Memory Block: 3\nProcess [2] Allocated to Memory Block: 5\nProcess [3] Unallocated\nProcess [4] Unallocated\nProcess [5] Unallocated", "TESTCASE_4": "7\n10 23 45 21 11 33 13\n5\n24 54 21 55 33\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nProcess [1] Allocated to Memory Block: 1\nProcess [2] Allocated to Memory Block: 2\nProcess [3] Allocated to Memory Block: 4\nProcess [4] Allocated to Memory Block: 5\nProcess [5] Unallocated", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
