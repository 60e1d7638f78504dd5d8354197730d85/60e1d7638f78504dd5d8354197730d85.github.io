{"Q_ID": "1516110004", "S_NAME": "Page Replacement", "Q_NAME": "Tamil Selvan's Least Six", "Q_DESC": "Professor Tamil Selvan told his students about page algorithm that : -  A page Replacement Algorithm is used to Replace the page on the Main memory to the one present in the Secondary Memory.\n\nIn LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm the one page that  is least recently used is Replaced by other page when no hit. Hit is a situation in which The same page out are entering is already present in main memory.\n\nWhen a page is replaced it creates a FAULT otherwise if it is already present is the main memory it is referred as hit.\nAfter this Professor Tamil Selvan asked his students to solve this problem.\n\nInput: -\nFirst line contains the Number of Frames followed by the Number of pages (n).\nThe next line will contain the n page values.\n\nOutput: -\nPrint the Number of Faults with the main memory status when fault occurred.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "4 12\n5 4 3 2 5 4 6 5 4 3 2 6\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n5 4\n5 4 3\n5 4 3 2\n5 4 6 2\n5 4 6 3\n5 4 2 3\n6 4 2 3\nfaults is=8", "TESTCASE_2": "3 10\n7 5 9 4 3 7 9 6 2 1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n7\n7 5\n7 5 9\n4 5 9\n4 3 9\n4 3 7\n9 3 7\n9 6 7\n9 6 2\n1 6 2\nfaults is=10", "TESTCASE_3": "3 6\n5 7 5 6 7 3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n5\n5 7\n5 7 6\n3 7 6\nfaults is=4", "TESTCASE_4": "3 7\n1 3 2 1 3 4 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n1 3\n1 3 2\n1 3 4\n2 3 4\nfaults is=5", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
