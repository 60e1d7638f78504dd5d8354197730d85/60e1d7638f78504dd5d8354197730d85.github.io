{"Q_ID": "1516110005", "S_NAME": "Page Replacement Algorith", "Q_NAME": "Page Replacement - Type 3", "Q_DESC": "Professor CHIRAG YADAV told his students about page algorithm that : -  A page Replacement Algorithm is used to Replace the page on the Main memory to the one present in the Secondary Memory.\n\nIn LFU (Least Frequently Used) Algorithm Based upon the frequency of the values present in the main memory the one value is replaced with the least frequency and the frequency of the replaced element is reset to 0.\n\nIf value of frequency are same then FIFO is followed.\n\nHit is a situation in which The same page out are entering is already present in main memory. When a page is replaced it creates a FAULT otherwise if it is already present is the main memory it is referred as hit.\n\nAfter this Professor CHIRAG asked his students to solve this problem to find the number of page Faults.\n\nInput: -\nFirst line contains the Number of Frames followed by the Number of pages (n).\nThe next line will contain the n page values.\n\nOutput: -\nPrint the Number of Faults.\n", "TESTCASE_1": "4 12\n5 4 3 2 5 4 6 5 4 3 2 6\n\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFault=8", "TESTCASE_2": "4 5\n5 3 1 2 4\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFault=5", "TESTCASE_3": "4 13\n7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nFault=6", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
