{"Q_ID": "1516110007", "S_NAME": "Page Replacement", "Q_NAME": "LRU", "Q_DESC": "Least Recently Used (or LRU) is a page replacement algorithm in which that page is replaced which is least recently used.\n\nFor example\n\nSuppose we have page reference string  5 4 3 5 5 2 1 1 2 1 4 3 5 2 1 6 8 9 and 4 empty frames.\n\nNow first page arrives (i.e. 5), it will cause page fault as there was no page in frames. ( 1st page fault ).  Then comes second page (i.e. 4), it was also not found in frames so it will cause a page fault (2nd page fault) and so on.\n\nIf a page is referenced and it is already present in frames no page fault will occur. But when a page is referenced and it is not present in the frames then it is allocated the empty frame if present. If there is not an empty frame then a page fault will occur and a page which is least recently used is replaced by the new page.\n\nInput:\n\n6 = Number of pages\n1 2 1 3 4 1 = Page reference string\n3 = Number of frames", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n1 2 1 3 4 1\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 0 \n1 2 0 \n1 2 0 \n1 2 3  \n1 4 3  \n1 4 3  \nPage Fault=4", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n4 1 2 4 5\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n4 0 0 \n4 1 0 \n4 1 2 \n4 1 2 \n4 1 5 \nPage Fault=4", "TESTCASE_3": "7\n1 2 1 3 4 1 2\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1 0 0 \n1 2 0 \n1 2 0 \n1 2 3 \n1 4 3 \n1 4 3 \n1 4 2 \nPage Fault=5", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
