The user will enter the height from which the object is dropped in meters (m).\n\nBecause the object is dropped its initial speed is 0m/s. Assume that the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s. \n\nvf =squareroot(vi+2ad)  \n\nYou can use the formula given above to compute the final speed, vf , when the initial speed, vi , acceleration, a, and distance, d, are known", "TESTCASE_1": "45\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe object will hit the ground at 29.70 m/s", "TESTCASE_2": "148\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe object will hit the ground at 53.86 m/s", "TESTCASE_3": "159\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe object will hit the ground at 55.82 m/s", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
