{"Q_ID": "1811110025", "S_NAME": "Input and Output", "Q_NAME": "Area of a Triangle", "Q_DESC": "When the length of its base and its height were known. It is also possible to compute the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known. Let s1, s2 and s3 be the lengths of the sides. Let s = (s1 + s2 + s3)/2. Then the area of the triangle\ncan be calculated using the following formula:\n\narea = sqrt(s*(s-s1)*(s-s2)*(s-s3))\n\nDevelop a program that reads the lengths of the sides of a triangle from the user and displays its area. \n\nDisplay the output to two floating point digits (%0.2f, %variablename)", "TESTCASE_1": "5\n4\n2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe area of the triangle is 3.8", "TESTCASE_2": "5\n5\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nThe area of the triangle is 10.8", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
