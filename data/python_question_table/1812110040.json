If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.", "TESTCASE_1": "10\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3\n5\n7", "TESTCASE_2": "20\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3\n5\n7\n11\n13\n17\n19", "TESTCASE_3": "15\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3\n5\n7\n11\n13", "TESTCASE_4": "38\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n2\n3\n5\n7\n11\n13\n17\n19\n23\n29\n31\n37", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
