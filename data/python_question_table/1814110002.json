{"Q_ID": "1814110002", "S_NAME": "Strings", "Q_NAME": "Remove the nth Index Character from a Non-Empty String", "Q_DESC": "Problem Solution: 1.Take a string from the user and store it in a variable.\n2. Take the index of the character to remove.\n3. Pass the string and the index as arguments to a function named remove.\n4. In the function, the string should then be split into two halves before the index character and after the index character.\n5. These two halves should then be merged together.\n6. Print the modified string.\n7. Exit.                                              \nHint to solve the problem:       \n1. User must enter a string and store it in a variable.\n2. User must also enter the index of the character to remove.\n3. The string and the index of the character to remove are passed as arguments to the remove function.\n4. In the function, the string is split into two halves before the index character and after the index character.\n5. The first half and the last half is then merged together using the + operator.\n6. The modified string is printed.\n\n", "TESTCASE_1": "eLab is an Auto Evaluation Tool\n3\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\neLa is an Auto Evaluation Tool", "TESTCASE_2": "eLab is an Auto Evaluation Tool\n0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nLab is an Auto Evaluation Tool", "TESTCASE_3": "eLab is an Auto Evaluation Tool\n9\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\neLab is a Auto Evaluation Tool", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
