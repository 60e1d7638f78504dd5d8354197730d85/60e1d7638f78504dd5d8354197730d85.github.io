{"Q_ID": "1815110006", "S_NAME": "Functions", "Q_NAME": "Is Valid Triangle ot Not ?", "Q_DESC": "If you have 3 straws, possibly of differing lengths, it may or may not be possible to lay them down so that they form a triangle when their ends are touching.\n\nFor example, if all of the straws have a length of 6 inches. then one can easily construct an equilateral triangle using them. However, if one straw is 6 inches. long, while the other two are each only 2 inches. long, then a triangle cannot be formed.\n\nIn general, if any one length is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two then the lengths cannot be used to form a triangle. Otherwise they can form a triangle. \n\nWrite a function that determines whether or not three lengths can form a triangle.\n\nThe function will take 3 parameters and return a Boolean result. In addition, write a program that reads 3 lengths from the user and demonstrates the behaviour of this function.\n\nRefer sample input and output for formatting specification.\n\nAll float values are displayed correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nAll text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output", "TESTCASE_1": "6\n1\n1\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTriangle cannot be formed", "TESTCASE_2": "7\n10\n5\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nYes Triangle can be formed", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
