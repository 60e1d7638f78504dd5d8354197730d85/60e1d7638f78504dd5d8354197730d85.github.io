We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one number. \n\nYour function should return true if the password passed to it as its only parameter is good. \n\nOtherwise it should return false. Include a main program that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good. \n\nEnsure that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into another file.\n\nRefer sample input and output for formatting specification.\n\nAll float values are displayed correct to 2 decimal places.\n\nAll text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output", "TESTCASE_1": "eLabTool2017\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nGood Password", "TESTCASE_2": "elabtool2017\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTry Again", "TESTCASE_3": "ELAB2017\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTry Again", "TESTCASE_4": "2017elab\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\nTry Again", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
