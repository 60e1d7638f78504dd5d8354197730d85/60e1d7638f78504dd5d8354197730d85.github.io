A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y co-ordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle.\n\nNote that two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping.\n\nrectanglesOverlap\n\nInput:\n\nThe first integer T denotes the number of test cases. For every test case, there are 2 lines of input. The first line consists of 4 integers: denoting the co-ordinates of the 2 points of the first rectangle. The first integer denotes the x co-ordinate and the second integer denotes the y co-ordinate of the left topmost corner of the first rectangle. The next two integers are the x and y co-ordinates of right bottom corner. Similarly, the second line denotes the cordinates of the two points of the second rectangle.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, output (either 1 or 0) denoting whether the 2 rectangles are overlapping. 1 denotes the rectangles overlap whereas 0 denotes the rectangles do not overlap.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n\n-10000 <= x,y <= 10000\n\nT denotes the number of test cases. x denotes the x co-ordinate and y denotes the y co-ordinate.", "TESTCASE_1": "2\n0 10 10 0\n5 5 15 0\n0 2 1 1\n-2 -3 0 2\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n1\n0", "TESTCASE_2": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_3": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_4": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0", "TESTCASE_5": "0\n###---###SEPERATOR---###---\n0"}
